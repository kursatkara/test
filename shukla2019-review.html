Abstract
A comprehensive review of the computational and experimental studies for ship-helo coupled airwakes is presented. The review starts with a brief introduction on the essential flow physics of ship and helicopter airwakes. The discussion is directed towards the physics of coupled behaviour of ship-helo airwakes in detail. The emphasis is on different experimental techniques and computational approaches used in the measurements/predictions of ship airwakes. Further, the problems in the ship airwake behaviour and its impact on helicopter manoeuvring over the ship helodeck are identified. This review article covers the research done on the ship-helo airwakes over the last six decades and attempts to list out the important findings and also establish the gaps in knowledge. The paper further gives future directions for developing a deeper understanding of different aspects of ship-helo coupled airwake interactions.

1. Introduction
Looking at the world map, it can be observed that most countries have ocean or sea-touching boundaries. Seas have been explored by humans mainly for commerce and military interests. Naval ships play a pivotal role for both these activities. Based on their specific applications and scope of the operations, naval ships are categorised as surface warships, submarines and support ships. Surface warships are further classified as frigates, aircraft carriers, amphibious warfare ships, destroyers, corvettes, gunboats, submarine chasers etc. Among these, frigate ships fall under the category of a small-war vessel and are placed in the front row in a typical fleet formation. Despite its small shape and size, frigate warships are known to be the most powerful combat ships. Typically, these vessels are loaded with all major weapons along with helicopters, which broaden the operational scope, such as rescue operations, stores and armament replenishment, troop transfer, medical evacuation etc. The ability of a frigate ship to allow helicopters to operate from the ship deck, enhances the operational capability of the frigate for both rescue/peacetime as well as combat operations.

Frigate ships are provided with a helodeck and a helo-hangar in order to facilitate helo operations. These structures are meant for helicopter take-off & landing and stowage purpose. The inclusion of new design features to accommodate helicopter operations on a frigate poses novel challenges to ship designers. These requirements are coupled with aerodynamic considerations of ship-helo interaction which may be contradictory to other considerations like stealth worthiness. Historically, the first reported incidence of a rotorcraft's shipboard landing was conducted by a US army pilot flying a Sikorsky XR-4 helicopter in 1943 [1]. This operation was carried out mainly to determine the feasibility of operating helicopters from non-aviation ships for antisubmarine patrols. Subsequently, the helicopter technology improved rapidly all through the late 1940's into the 1950's. Though, the US Navy helicopters had limited applications at an early stage, ten years down the line the scenario completely transformed. At that time, it was realized that the usage of a helicopter on naval ships would phenomenally enhance the maritime capabilities. Consequently, the ship-rotorcraft landing option lead to a common design feature for the naval frigate ships. Gradually, this possibly caught the attention of other navies across the world and emerged as an important research area in late 1955. As a result, a formal international organization named “The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP)” came into existence in 1957. This program was primarily concerned with the joint cooperation on defence science and technology matters. Subsequently, the TTCP became a formal long-standing international organization to initiate collaborative research.

Flow over the frigate ship helodeck even at stable sea conditions is turbulent and quite complex in nature. In addition, the presence of coupled airwakes due to the interaction of ship and helo-downwash makes the flow behaviour even more complicated [2]. In maritime terminology, the ship-helicopter take-off/recovery operations are often referred to as the Dynamic Interface (DI). Currently, the complexities associated with DI are evaluated primarily by performing high-risk test trials. These test trials are conducted by Experimental Test Pilots (ETPs) after the ship has been constructed and typically involve very high cost. In addition to the high risk and high cost of such trials, there are several limitations of this approach, (i) the experience and insight of test pilots may not be generalizable to other ship-helicopter combinations (ii) it may also be difficult to implement the gathered insight on the same ship (that has already been constructed) and (iii) it is not practical for any testing exercise to cover a very wide range of wind/sea conditions that may be prevalent in real-life scenarios.

Thus, it is very crucial to develop a design tool employing both experimental as well as computational techniques to accurately simulate the ship-helicopter coupled environmental regime in early design stages itself. Employment of such tools would ease the burden of expensive and risky sea trials. In this review, we identify merits and demerits of the various methods used by researchers in the past for experimentation and computation to understand the ship-helo coupled airwakes aerodynamics on helodeck. We present a review of the progress made by the research community over the last six decades in (i) understanding the complex flow phenomenon that exists in the ship-helo dynamic interface environment, (ii) developing superior computational approaches for predicting such flow fields and, (iii) interpreting experimental/computational observations in terms of pilot workload.

This review is organized into six sections. In Section 2, we present a brief discussion on the essential flow features that exist in a typical ship-helo interacting environment. Subsequently, Section 3 Experimental modelling, 4 Computational modelling, present a review of the experimental modelling and computational studies on ship airwakes respectively. Section 5, details both the experimental and computational studies on the coupled ship-helo airwake environment. Finally, Section 6, concludes the review with a summary of the important findings and possible future directions of this research field.

2. Essential ship-helo airwakes features
This section presents a brief discussion on the essential flow features existing on a typical ship-helo interacting environment. Such details of the essential flow features help us to gain a better insight into the underlying flow physics. Based on the overall wake characteristics of the frigate's ship-helo environment, two distinct regions are identified: i) the near wake region and ii) the far wake region [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. The near wake region is marked as the region just behind the helo-hangar, i.e. the helodeck. This wake region is associated with steep velocity gradients, unsteady recirculating flows, high turbulence levels and contain significant amount of low-frequency energy carried by the large-scale eddies. In the process of dissipation from the formation of larger eddies into smaller eddies, many of these eddy structures are of similar scale as the helicopter rotor which significantly influences the rotor motion. Moreover, the near wake region also affects the helicopter aerodynamics by imposing fluctuating forces and moments on the rotor blades [7]. Therefore, the rotor modelling has been considered to be very important in the near wake region. In contrast, the far wake region is the region downstream of the ship and up to approximately one ship length from the stern. Two-fundamental mechanisms namely, convection and turbulent diffusion govern the flow in the far wake region. It is anticipated that sufﬁciently far downstream, the unfavourable effects of momentum deﬁcit and increased level of turbulence will vanish due to the dominating nature of turbulent diffusion of the wake [3]. Thus, the interaction of ship airwakes on the helicopter and vice versa in the far wake region is considered rather simple and controllable based on ETP's flight experience. Therefore, the rotor modelling has been considered less important for this region.

Identification of the flow characteristics of the near and far wake regions suggests that the main emphasis has to be primarily put on the near wake measurements/prediction to understand the complexity associated with the ship-helo airwakes problem. Also, the near wake region influences most on the ETPs flight experience. Thus, this idea seems justified that the combined ship-helo operations are performed frequently over the helodeck region which is indeed dominated by the near wake flow characteristics. Additionally, the near wake region also impacts the boundary conditions of the far wake region. In line with the importance of the near wake region, the subsequent sections will cover the details of near wake flow features of flow past a ship (Section 2.1), flow past a helicopter (Section 2.2) and ship-helo coupled airwake (Section 2.3).

2.1. Flow features of ship airwake
Over the years, the ship airwake flow aerodynamics has been investigated by many researchers. The reported literature reveals that most of the earlier studies of ship airwakes were indeed performed using simple representative bodies like the backward facing step (BFS) and rectangular bluff bodies [4]. Typically, a bluff body is defined as ‘a body which has a large separated region downstream (wake flow)’ [6]. Detailed features of the rectangular bluff body flow are explained very well by Hunt et al. [8]. Based on their flow visualizations, Hunt et al. [8] found that the flow has a complex stationary/periodic vortex system in the wake. The primary vortex is an inverted U-shaped vortex, whose ends remain in contact with the ground on the downwind side of the body. Besides, the numerous horseshoe vortices that wrap themselves around the upstream base of the body and trail towards downstream have also been reported (see Fig. 1). Moreover, authors also found that the flow-field can be substantially altered by the presence of shear and turbulence in the free-stream flow.

The flow past a BFS is a simplified flow configuration which has been often reported in the literature to understand flow separation and reattachment in the rear side of a bluff body. Driver et al. [9] performed an extensive experimental study on flow past a backward facing step. The essential flow features; separated shear layers, large recirculation region and corner vortex structure in the wake of a typical BFS flow is explained well by the authors (see Fig. 2). Later, Shafer [10] confirmed that the key flow features of the airwake of a ship (Destroyer-DDG81) over the helodeck are indeed similar to the combination of flow over a rectangular bluff body and a 3D BFS flow (see Fig. 3). Also, the flow characteristics include vortex shedding, flow separation and flow reattachment which are qualitatively quite similar.

2.2. Helicopter airwakes flow structure
A helicopter rotor creates a downwash which when obstructed by the helicopter fuselage leads to a wake region being created below the helicopter. Interaction of this wake (helicopter airwake) with the ship airwake creates challenging conditions for helicopter hover, take-off and landing. Typically, the basic flow features of a rotor are quite different from the fixed wing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. For example, the fixed-wing VTOL Harrier Class aircraft's downwash commonly has a low level of swirl and high downdraft. It is often described as an impinging jet downwash. On the other hand, the rotorcraft/helicopter downwash has a significant amount of swirl and relatively less downdraft. Distinguishable features of the downwash wake structures in both the cases have been highlighted by D. J. Hoiiler [11]. Besides, the author also presents the analytical method for determination of the downwash flow-field parameters for VTOL aircraft.

The principal features of rotorcraft airwakes are time-dependent tip vortices, the rotor angular speed and horseshoe vortices (see Fig. 4). Additionally, the helicopter airwake causes the unstable recirculation region during the take-off and landing conditions. This flow region is hugely influenced by the so called “Out of Ground Effect (OGE)” during take-off/hovering and “In Ground Effect (IGE)” during landing conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 5. In either case, the combined airwake features of ship-helo interface form a very complex coupled airwake pattern. Appearance of this phenomenon triggers a vast coupled vortex region which is highly unsteady and turbulent in nature. Moreover, the presence of the helo-rotor in this region induces unsteady forces on the rotor blades leading to a phenomenon of blade sailing [12]. In the worst-case scenario, it leads to the so called “vortex ring state”. The term vortex ring state describes an aerodynamic condition, where a helicopter undergoes loss of lift even when the engine is applying maximum power.

2.3. Coupled ship-helo airwakes – the dynamic interface
The combined ship-helo coupled airwake flow structure is very complex in nature. This includes a variety of flow phenomena; (i) impact of roll and pitch motion of the ship on airwake, (ii) impact of air-sea interaction on helodeck, (iii) ship-helicopter airwake interaction, (iv) vortical airwakes interaction of hot-exhaust smoke, (v) transonic flow on blades and rotor downwash, and (vi) blade-vortex interaction and blade tip vortices. Typical ship-helo coupled airwake flow characteristics are illustrated in Fig. 6.

The coupled ship-helo airwake flow characteristics need to be tackled to maximise the operational availability of both ship and helicopter. The most generic approach to tackle this problem is to asses the ship-helicopter interaction, also referred as “Dynamic Interface Testing”. In the early 1950's, this approach was used to conduct both land and ship based helicopter interface testing. In the late 1960's, the approach improved immensely for the ship-helicopter interface testing [13].

The DI testing is an activity undertaken to establish the limits of the wind and sea conditions in which safe launch/recovery of the helicopter can be conducted from the helodeck of a ship. The DI testing process is conducted in two phases. The initial phase includes experimental full-scale sea measurement followed by the analysis and analytical phase, which is concerned with computational analysis. Overall, this traditional approach investigates various parameters like; launch and recovery of rotorcraft, engaging and disengaging of rotors, vertical replenishment and in-flight refuelling envelopes etc. However, this method does not enable a comprehensive and timely solution for the dynamic interface problem at the design stage. Currently, this method is used commonly with the close conjunction of the flight simulator to assess the adequacy, effectiveness and safety of the shipboard aviation [14].

3. Experimental modelling
The early experimental modelling of ship-helo dynamic interface problems was started way back in the 1950's. The experimental measurements were taken to investigate ship-helo dynamic interface because of insufficient resources for pursuing the computational solutions. Also, due to the lack of any prior information on ship-helo dynamic interface problems, researchers conducted experimental investigations of full-scale (sea-scale). One of the primary motivations of such investigations was to correlate the flow phenomena between the full-scale and model-scale conditions.

Early experimental investigations reported that the stand-alone experimental modelling of the ship-helo dynamic interface poses massive modelling challenges due to (i) complex ship geometry, (ii) coupled ship-helo airwakes flow structures, (iii) combined ship-helo relative motion, (iv) air-sea wave interface (multi-phase), and (v) harsh environmental conditions (sea and weather). Further, there was limited understanding of ship-helo dynamic interface flow phenomena at that time. Keeping these limitations, researchers at that time proceeded by splitting the stand-alone ship-helo dynamic interface modelling into three new model-scale experiments, namely, (i) sea and ship motion modelling (ii) ship airwake modelling (iii) combined ship-helo airwake modelling [14].

The idea of identification of three-separate model-scale experiments was conceived to ease the overall experimental modelling challenges and gain an understanding of various aspects of the DI process. The first set of experimental investigations covered the scope of air-sea wave interference and the ship motion (roll, pitch, and yaw) phenomena. The second set of experimental investigations focused on the challenges associated with the geometric effects of ship airwake structures. The third set of experiments emphasised on understanding of the challenges associated with combined ship-helo geometric effect and relative motion.

The challenge of complex ship geometry modelling persisted since the research was being conducted on different ship geometries all over the globe. Moreover, the ship geometries which were used for investigations were confidential, thus could not be shared in the open literature. Hence, a need was felt for a baseline ship geometry having essential geometric features of a frigate ship which could be used for investigation world wide. Typically, the underlying geometric features of a frigate ship include; (i) hull/nose, (ii) mast, (iii) superstructure, (iv) hangar, and (v) helodeck (as shown in Fig. 7).

The requirement of a baseline ship model was resolved by “The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP)”. The TTCP proposed two ‘Simplified Frigate Ship (SFS)’ geometries (SFS1 and SFS2) under the collaborative program for helicopter-ship DI research. Initially, a simplified ship geometry known as ‘SFS1’ was developed in early 1985. The SFS1 was made up of rectangular shape blocks without a nose. Subsequently, a more realistic version of the simplified ship with a triangular bow was attached to SFS1 and was named as SFS2. This was developed in late 1998. A schematic diagram of both the TTCP variants; SFS1 and SFS2 are shown in Fig. 8 (dimensions are in feet). The principal objective of this program was to promote distribution of full and model-scale experimental database of helicopter-ship DI research in the public domain. For a detailed summary of the TTCP collaborative program, see Ref. [15].

Our review of experimental modelling starts with an overview of relevant governing flow parameters (Section 3.1) used in modelling of full-scale flow conditions at model-scale experiments. The following sub-sections review the sea and ship motion modelling (Section 3.2) and the ship airwake modelling (Section 3.3). The emphasis of this review is primarily on the ship airwake modelling. Review of combined ship-helo airwake modelling is covered separately in Section 5.

3.1. Governing flow parameters
Typically, the model-experimental measurements conducted in wind/water tunnels require matching of several input flow parameters to simulate the exact full-scale conditions. These parameters are commonly referred as the governing flow parameters. A comprehensive overview of various governing flow parameters is given in detail by Healey [13], the author's review summarises all the essential governing parameters related to modelling the full-scale airflow upstream of a ship at model-scale. Out of all the above parameters, we only present the ones which are frequently used in the experimental modelling of Dynamic Interface (DI).
i)
Atmospheric Turbulence - The atmospheric wind turbulence often plays a crucial role in the dynamic interface testing. Atmospheric turbulence gives an overall idea of the influence of atmospheric wind speeds that exist at the time of DI at full-scale environmental conditions. This parameter governs the physics of flow turbulence in model test experiments.

Importance of generating appropriate atmospheric turbulence in the model experiments is highlighted by Houbolt [16], Panofsky [17], and Davenport [18]. The authors clarified that the high cross-wind conditions relatively create a more precarious situation for the dynamic interface. Several statistical data and empirical relationships are available which are often used in model experiments to input the high wind atmospheric turbulence. Detailed list of such empirical relationships are available [19,20].

ii)
Turbulence Intensity Level - Measure of atmospheric turbulence in crosswinds is often represented by turbulence intensity level. The turbulent intensity level is dependent on the ground roughness scale (z0) and the elevation of the ground (Z). The value of ground roughness has no direct relationship with the elevation of obstacles. However, an empirical relationship is suggested by Garratt [20] to correlate the roughness length scale (z0), altitude (Z) and turbulence intensity (I), as shown in Fig. 9. Further, the author also reports the relation between roughness length scale (z0) of sea surface as a function of mean wind speed (U) at the average helodeck elevation, i.e. 10 m.

iii)
Turbulence Length Scale (L) - An estimate of turbulence at given wind speed can also be calculated through its length scale (L). The corresponding length scale often denoted by turbulence length scale can be calculated using the following correlation
(2)L = 25 × Z0.35 / z0 0.062
where, Z is elevation and z0 is the roughness length scale of sea surface (equation (1)).;

iv)
Mean Wind Speed Profile (U) - Estimation of mean wind speed profile is important, as the atmospheric stratification creates gradients in the wind speed which creates a boundary layer. To estimate the mean wind speed, Davenport [18] proposed the following expression;
(3)U/Ug = (Z / Zg)0.11
where, Ug is the velocity gradient, and Zg is the gradient height inside the boundary layer.

v)
Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) - The boundary layer created because of the atmospheric stratification is referred as the atmospheric boundary layer. In the case of several bluff bodies such as buildings, trucks and ships, the ABL flow effects should be accurately modelled to achieve the full-scale conditions. Modelling of the atmospheric boundary layer in model experiments is done using wind speed profile. The necessity of modelling the atmospheric boundary layer during model-scale experiments is decided by a non-dimensional parameter known as Jensen number (Je) [21]. Jensen number (Je) is a ratio of the characteristic length (LC) to the roughness length (z0) and is given by the following expression;
(4)Je = LC / z0


if Je is above the cut-off value (typically 2000) the roughness length effect is independent of Je, and the boundary layer effects are not relevant to the problem solution. In a typical marine vehicle, the surface roughness length (z0) is of the order of 10−3 m [22].

For the case of Je = 2000, the characteristic length LC should be in the range of 2 m (equation (4)). The length of ship beam for the case of small warships like frigate and destroyer is about 14–19 m with the helodeck elevations in the range of 4–6 m which gives a Jensen number in the range of 4000–6000. Therefore, for such cases, the atmospheric boundary layer effects are not necessary to be modelled in model test experiments [23]. On the other side, when Je is less than 2000, the atmospheric boundary layer effects have to be modelled in the model test experiments [24].
vi)
Physical Similarity – The primary and fundamental requirement of model experiments is the physical similarity between the full-scale and model-scale. The two systems (full-scale & model-scale) are called physically similar if governed by the same physics even if operating under different sets of conditions. Thus, the full-scale and model-scale experiments must have the physical similarity.


There are three conditions which constitute the complete similarity between the prototype and model conditions, namely, geometric, kinematic and dynamic similarity conditions. The first type of physical law is ‘geometric similarity (λL)’. It requires all the dimensions of the model and prototype to have the same length scale ratio:
(5)λL = Lm / Lp
where, Lm and Lp represent the model and the prototype lengths, respectively. The second type of physical similarity law is the ‘kinematic similarity (λV)’. It requires the model and prototype to have the same velocity scale ratio at all points [25].
(6)λV = Vm / Vp
where, Vm and Vp represent the model and the prototype flow velocities, respectively. Finally, the third type of physical similarity is the ‘dynamic similarity’. It exists when the model and prototype satisfy the condition of geometric and kinematic similarity along with force scale ratios.

For the case of incompressible and non-zero free surface flow, if dynamic similarity exists the model and prototype Reynolds number (Re) must be equal, i.e. Rem = Rep [26]. Further, if kinematic viscosity is identical for both the fluids, i.e. prototype and model are tested in the same fluid under atmospheric conditions then this criterion leads to the Reynolds number matching. The Reynolds number matching gives the correlations between velocity (λV) and time-scale ratio (λT) as
(7)λV = λL−1
(8)λT = λL / λV = λL2

however, it is not necessary that Reynolds numbers must be equal for the case of large bluff bodies like ships. For such cases, the flow is Reynolds number independent above some threshold value of the Reynolds number. Typically, the threshold value of Reynolds number is 104 for the case of naval ships. At this value, the flow over a ship boundary layer and the wake are both fully turbulent [27]. Indeed, Lumsden [28] showed that the flow characteristics for several bluff bodies including ships are unchanged with Re varying from 104 to 107.

3.2. Sea and ship motion modelling
Historically, ships have been used since the 15th century for migration and commerce purposes. However, the first frigate ship came into existence in 1583, primarily for naval warfare. Till 18th century, sea-keeping advantages and rapid developments of frigate ship led to its commissioning into all the navies across the globe. Although, considerable amount of research was carried out on ship design, but no reported literature was available on sea and ship motion modelling in the open domain.

The evolutionary study of sea and ship motion can be considered to have been started by Froude [29] by considering the roll motions of a ship in 1860's. Subsequently, over the next three decades, significant research was carried out to understand the six degrees of ship motion; three translational – heave, sway, and surge; three rotational – roll, pitch, and yaw. In 1898, Krylov [30] presented a theoretical method for predictions of the pitching motion of ships on waves and of the stresses produced by pitching motion. The next substantial work for the ship motion was reported by Haskind [31] in 1952, where the concept of heaving and pitching motion of a ship was explained by hydrodynamic theory. In the same decade, another theory (linear strip theory) on ship motion was proposed by Korvin-Kroukovsky & Jacobs [32], where an intuitive analysis approach was adopted against the existing mathematical approach.

The strip theory was not valid for low frequencies or high speeds and thus failed to give reasonable results for fast ships like frigates on quartering seas [33]. In maritime terminology, the term ‘quartering seas’ refers to a state when sea wave heading direction is not parallel to the centerline of the ship. Likewise, if the sea wave heading direction is parallel to the ship centerline, then it is referred as ‘beam seas.’ The sea wave heading at a certain angle off the bow is referred as ‘forward quarter’ and the direct heading towards the ship is referred as ‘head seas.’

To remove the limitations of strip theory at low frequencies or high speeds, Newman [33,34] proposed a ‘unified strip theory’ in 1978. The author claimed that the unified strip theory could be valid for all frequencies, because it takes into account the wave interactions between sea and ship. With sufficient understanding and availability of a number of theories, three ship motion prediction programs were developed; (i) NMIwave, by the national maritime institute (ii) NAVAIRENGCEN ship motion program by Brown and Camaratta [35] and (iii) DTNSRDC by Meyers et al. [36]. The idea behind such ship motion prediction programs was to facilitate the ETPs to observe the motion of a ship with some reasonable accuracy and was expected to minimise the pilot work load.

In the intervening years, substantial research was conducted to improve the seakeeping performance of the ship. It was anticipated that the sea and ship motion impart energy into airwakes which could affect the seakeeping performance of the ship, especially during the massive ship movements. For the case of a smaller vessel like a frigate, this problem may persist and lead to the creation of a time lag between ship motion and the airwake response. Due to this reason, the frigate ship motion amplitudes are significantly increased and periods are relatively small. Therefore, motion-induced effects on the airwake and handling qualities are very significant [13].

Subsequently, the research trend of ship hull design has been getting popular among the researchers. Bales and Cummins [37] investigated the influence of hull form on seakeeping characteristics. Authors found that a small mono-hull ship is very sensitive to the sea state, due to the short length and large waterplane area. Thus, it severely weakens the manoeuvrability and seakeeping of mono-hull ships in rough seas. Later, Clark et al. [38] proposed three criteria for evaluating manoeuvrability of a ship namely, (i) the turning ability, (ii) course stability, and (iii) manual steering ability. Further, Wilson & Hsu [39] studied the wave cancellation effects of a concept tri-hull and found that the majority of the contribution to the wave production resistance originated from the center body and strut interactions. It led towards the idea of the tri-hull ships to improve seakeeping performance and speed limit. The concept of multi-hull ships originated in the second half of the twentieth century. Dubrovskiy [[40], [41], [42], [43]] presented the concept of the triple-hull frigate and highlighted the advantages of multi-hull ships over the conventional mono-hull ships. With respect to the DI operation, it is also certain that the application of tri-hull would facilitate relatively a bigger helodeck area which indeed helps to increase the rotorcraft control margin greatly. Thus, currently the multi-hull ship design is a most popular research area in the field of ship and sea motion research.

In the context of the present scenario, it can be said that the sea and ship motion are relatively well-understood as a subject compared to the ship-helo airwake. Therefore, the review is restricted to a brief summary of sea and ship motion modelling only. All the reported references which have been gathered for the sea and ship motion topic are summarised in Table 1.

3.3. Ship airwake modelling
Wind/water tunnel testing on ship airwake characteristics was started in 1955. The formation of TTCP promoted activities of experimental modelling of ship airwake characteristics because the effects of ship airwakes on ship motion was untouched as well as not understood during that time period.

The challenge associated with ship airwake experimental modelling persisted in the early days since the ship airwake characteristics were highly unsteady. Moreover, no suitable experimental device was available at that time which could offer the spatial and temporal correlations for three-dimensional airwakes simultaneously. Mostly the multi-hole probes with flow visualisation and thermal anemometry techniques have been used in practice for ship airwake measurements.

Multi-hole probes can provide mean velocity measurements. This approach is limited to offering the mean flow properties and does not give any information about the fluctuating flow aspects. Thus, the unsteady aspects of the airwake cannot be gathered through this technique. This limitation was partially resolved through the application of flow visualisation. The scope of flow visualisation can deliver the qualitative structure of flow-field, which could help understand the fluctuating flow aspect.

The flow visualisation tests and multi-hole probe measurements are two separate experiments. In the early 1950's, these two experiments were done independently of each other. Thus, some limited flow aspects were only studied. However, in the following years, most researchers often combined these two aspects to gauge mean flow properties as well as the overall spatial flow aspects.

Flow visualisation techniques for the determination of the spatial airwakes vortex locations have been in use since the earliest study of the problem in 1950 (see Refs. [[44], [45], [46], [47]]). During 1950's, the fluctuating behaviour of airwakes was often accessed independently by flow visualisation. Various flow visualisation techniques were in practice such as (i) hydrogen sulfide (HS), (ii) helium bubbles, (iii) oil flow, (iv) tufts and (v) smoke. Selection of a specific flow visualisation technique depends upon the size of the wind/water tunnel, model dimensions and flow physics.

The hydrogen sulfide (HS) flow visualisation is carried out using lead acetate paint. Typically, the model geometry is painted with lead acetate and kept in the wind tunnel where the HS is being transported from upstream. Due to the chemical properties of HS, series of black stains are left on the lead acetate paint. These stains help identify the flow aspects of the ship superstructure [46]. In a similar manner, the helium bubble (air-helium mixture) and oil flow visualisation approach is used to characterise flow aspects through flow visualisation [48].

Another possible way to conduct flow visualisation has been by using tufts and oil flow. Nolan [44] has reported the use of tufts and oil flow visualisation in detail. In general, the ‘tufts’ are small cotton threads and are assumed to have nearly zero mass and therefore can swing easily into the flow direction. Most common materials used for tufts include monofilament nylon, and polyester or cotton threads with sufficient thickness. It has been used to visualise the surface flow topology in a two-dimensional plane and gauge turbulence level in the vicinity of a ship's superstructure. The whipping of the tufts indicates the location of the vortex structure. Besides, the frequency of whipping at any point indicates the qualitative indication of different turbulence flow regimes. The flow characteristics of tuft motion in different flow regimes are shown in Table 2.

The first four flow visualisation techniques were often used to gather the flow information mainly on the geometrical surface. However, these techniques cannot provide the locations of vortex-pair and spatial behaviour of vortex formation/dissipation. Thus, a more accurate technique; smoke visualisation was preferred to visualise the surface as well as free stream flow behaviour for the case of ship airwake. It was found that the smoke particles move precisely with the flow and hence provide reasonably accurate visualisation of the flow around the ship. Overall, there are two distinct ways to conduct the ﬂow visualisation with smoke; either the smoke can be injected into the ﬂow from an external nozzle, or the smoke is ejected from the model (in the vicinity of the region of interest). In the first technique, the smoke is being transported with the upstream velocity and shows the cross-section of the vortices. Whereas, in the second approach, the smoke trails are transported with the local velocity and show a vortex trace (see Fig. 10).

Fig. 10. Flow of plume exhaust along ship superstructure revealing the smoke trails transportation (from, Kulkarni et al. [52]).

Various types of smoke sources have been used as the transport medium in the wind tunnel for conducting flow visualisation. Like, use of wood smoke has been reported by Nolan [44] and Acker [45]. Similarly, Ower & Third [46], Third & Ower [47] used the smoke injector to locate the turbulent boundary layer over the ship's superstructure during wind tunnel and field measurements on the full-scale ship. Woolman & Healey [49], Seshadri & Singh [50], Seshadri et al. [51] and Kulkarni et al. [52] have also reported the use of glycerin-based smoke visualisation to trace the path of exhaust plume after its exit from a funnel in their wind tunnel studies. A detailed review of the ship airwake flow visualisation and measurement techniques is reported by W. D. Reddy [53]. The author compared various experimental techniques used for obtaining ship airwake flow visualisations and evaluated the utility, strengths/limitations of each method.

Subsequently, in the intervening years, experimental measurements with multi-hole probes were started in the wind tunnel. White and Chaddock [54] were the first who attempted recreation of ship airwakes around the aircraft carrier (USS Lexington). A uniform velocity profile with 0.3% turbulence level was provided at the inlet of the wind tunnel. The authors found that the model-scale wind tunnel experiments did not recreate the full-scale flow features. This discrepancy between full and model-scale flow could be attributed to the inappropriate atmospheric turbulence intensity fed at the inlet. Later, the authors conducted the same experiments in a water tunnel with the quest of eliminating the errors caused due to the inappropriate input of atmospheric turbulence. However, the trend was nearly the same and did not show any improvement in the water tunnel measurements. Despite showing deviations between the full-scale and model-scale experimental database (White and Chaddock [54]), the study proved to be a benchmark for future model-scale experimental studies. Researchers used the full-scale experimental data to validate their model-scale experiments. Later in 1978, Fortenbaugh [55] used this database and developed the first analytical airwake model for a fast frigate (1052 & CVA-16 model). The principal objective of promoting such analytical airwake model was to correlate the full-scale and model-scale experimental datasets. It was believed that the convenience of such correlations would certainly help to analyse the shipboard launch and recovery of VTOL aircraft.

Although the popularity of multi-hole probes in the investigation of mean-flow features offered new insights into ship airwakes, their use was still limited because of the complex flow features present on the helodeck. The probes were unable to give accurate data at the desired locations on the ship (wake region: free-shear layer and reverse flow) and nearby regions [56]. Typically, the naval ship superstructures are often geometrically much more complicated as compared to their predecessors or the counterparts in the passenger/cargo ships. Also, the warships possess many appendages which are aerodynamically bluff bodies (masts, superstructure/bridge blocks etc.). The inception of TTCP promotes the use of simplified ship geometry which facilitates researchers to peruse experiments in independent groups. Besides, it eases the distribution of full-scale/model-scale experimental databases. Due to this reason, the TTCP generic geometry gained popularity among researchers and was widely used as a benchmark geometry for model-scale wind tunnel experiments. The adaptations of TTCP geometry also enables the ease of measurements with multi-hole probes. Cheney and Zan [57], Zan [58] and Makkar et al. [59] adopted the TTCP geometry and used the multi-hole probes and flow visualisation for their model-scale wind tunnel experiments of ship airwakes.

Overall, the mean flow measurements combined with flow visualisation provide valuable insight into the ship airwakes flow phenomenon. The flow visualisation technique offers a qualitative understanding of flow behaviour, which helps identify the extent of unsteadiness at desirable locations. The mean flow quantities govern the fundamental aspect of any flow-field, and the multi-hole probe indeed can offer the mean flow statistics. Hence, both methods are popular and are frequently being used by the researchers for generating benchmark experimental data as well as validation of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methodology. However, both methods have their limitations. These methods neither provide quantitative insights into the fluctuating flow nor measure the spatial and temporal flow statistics.

Till late 1970's, many attempts had been made on model-scale ship airwakes experiments in wind tunnels with varied degree of success. However, accurate representation of the full-scale (sea-scale) airwake flow phenomenon at model-scale conditions still remained a challenging task. The early studies provided preliminary understandings of the unsteady ship airwake flow behaviour, but could not offer any quantitative details of the unsteady flow statistics. Details of the unsteady flow statistics are essential to get the spatial and temporal correlations. The helicopter responses to turbulence condition are often governed by the frequency and structure of the airwake. Thus, the time-correlation (statistical relationship between same fluctuating random variable measured at two different times) measurements are required to get the auto-correlations of air turbulence in the near wake region in wind tunnel experiments [60]. Consequently, quantitative time-varying airwake measurements were keenly sought by the researchers.

Later in 1976, the first reported quantitative time-varying ship airwake measurement was conducted by Garnett [07, 61]. The author conducted experimental investigations of the aerodynamic ship airwake turbulence on the FF 1052 frigate (1:50 scale) and DD-963 Destroyer (1:80 scale) ship models in the Boeing Vertol VSTOL wind tunnel. Measurements were taken using grids of split-film hot-wire anemometer probes for uniform velocity profiles with low ambient turbulence. The inlet velocity and turbulence boundary condition were similar to that of White and Chaddock [54]. The author did not simulate the atmospheric turbulent boundary layer in the experiments. Further, the author conducted flow visualisation studies based on the Sulphur & Helium Bubble approach. The technique was useful in visualizing the 3D behaviour of the flow in the vicinity of the superstructure area. The prime objective of the investigation was to map the steady and dynamic airwake turbulence components separately. Availability of such mapped information became useful for validation purpose. Overall, the correlations between the full-scale and model-scale data were still relatively weak.

In the early 1990's, Healey's group [02, 03, 04, 05, 06 and 62] reported a series of excellent state-of-the-art experimental work for DI modelling. They have given more attention specifically to different aspects of DI and their effects on the helodeck flow phenomena. Besides, they have also investigated the ship superstructure aerodynamics and ship airwakes effects experimentally. The authors considered Garnett's [07, 61] work for their validation during the initial stages of the experiments. They extended Garnett's [07, 61] work and performed a similar wind tunnel investigation on the DD-963 Destroyer model. In contrast to Garnett's [07, 61] experiments, Healey's group simulated the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) in their investigations. The key motivation behind the series of experiments was to get the database of mean and fluctuating velocities, turbulence intensities and turbulent spectra along a typical helicopter attitude over the helodeck. All the experiments were performed at a Reynolds number of 1.1 × 104. The selected Reynolds number was nearly three orders of magnitude lower than the full-scale range. The authors adopted the Reynolds number of 1.1 × 104, because the flow features were Reynolds number independent above this value. Experiments conducted by Healey's group were done by using hot-wire anemometry. Authors also conducted flow visualisation studies to identify the principal flow characteristics over the helodeck. Several combinations of static ship pitch and yaw and heel and yaw were investigated under static ship condition for yaw angle ranges between ±30° (concerning the ship bow). The authors identified that the vital flow features were the shedding of vortices from sharp edges of ship superstructures. The turbulent wake increased in size as the wind moved away to the bow. The authors found that the addition of a fixed pitch or roll offset did not considerably affect the airwakes compared to the initial case (00 pitch, heel, and yaw). However, the fluctuations under dynamic conditions were not tested by the authors. Thus, the effect of ship motion on the airwakes is not acknowledged. Overall, they obtained reasonable matching between the full-scale and model-scale wind tunnel testing with ABL. These studies revealed that the levels of turbulence intensity over the helodeck are higher at 30° wind condition than for a headwind condition (00) [03]. Further, the spectral analysis of vertical velocity fluctuations over the helodeck showed that most of the turbulent energy was in the range of 0.1–10 Hz [05]. The general trend of turbulent energy confirms that the helo-hangar and helodeck regions experience the high-frequency energy, whereas, the regions away from the ship comprises relatively low-frequency energy. The authors have also highlighted that due to single point measurements low velocities were recorded near the ship model. Thus, the authors recommended either multi-point measurements with pulsed wire or laser doppler-anemometer for accurate measurements in the vicinity of the ship.

The importance of mean and fluctuating velocities, turbulent spectra, spatial and temporal correlations of ship airwake was also justified by Zan and Garry [60]. The authors have conducted a wind tunnel test on a TTCP SFS1 generic model. Similar to Garnett's [07, 46] and Healey's group [03, 05, 62], they also adopted thermal anemometry (hotwire anemometry) to measure the spatial and temporal flow statistics. The experiments were conducted at a similar Reynolds number range i.e. 104 at headwind speed of 21 m/s. The authors reported that the auto-correlation at the helodeck region exceeds 0.5 for time lags not exceeding 0.5 s, i.e. the flow over the helodeck remained significantly correlated. Hence, they recommended that the accurate modelling of ship airwake flow physics requires spatial and temporal time-varying three-dimensional airwake statistics. Further, the authors also emphasised the necessity of fully-coupled ship airwake investigation for accurate airwake modelling.

In 1998, Zan et al. [63] continued their previous investigations on ship airwakes and started a collaborative study of fully-coupled ship airwakes through the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). It was the first attempt by the researchers to investigate the effect of fully-coupled ship airwake phenomena. Before this study, the investigation on ship airwake modelling was conducted on the assumption of the isolated airwake condition [60]. Therefore, the researchers were keen to overcome the limitations associated with the previous studies. The authors conducted both experimental and computational investigations on a realistic Halifax-Class Patrol Frigate (CPF) ship (1:50 scale) with fully-coupled ship airwake condition. Experiments were conducted on two WOD conditions; 00 and 120. In contrast to the author's (Zan's group) [60] past studies, they used a hot film anemometer with the arrangement of horizontal upstream rods to model the atmospheric boundary layer profile in the wind tunnel. The author found that the experiments conducted on the CPF geometry showed asymmetry in the measurements, because of the realistic ship appendage features. Later, they decided to adopt a simplified version of CPF geometry to overcome the asymmetry present in the experimental database. The modified CPF geometry was a simplified geometry made from the CPF model by removing the realistic ship appendage features. The scope of using the simplified CPF model was to generate accurate data for validation purposes and also to overcome the asymmetric nature of the experimental results. The author reported a reasonable correlation between the experimental and full-scale (sea-trial) data along with computational results. This study also highlights the qualitative effects of airwake interference at full-scale helicopter operations.

Later, Lee [64] also conducted wind tunnel experiments on the TTCP SFS2 geometry (1:100 scale). Similar to Zan and Garry [60], the author performed experiments in the low-speed wind tunnel (cross section: 2 m × 3 m) at the Aerodynamics Laboratory of the National Research Council (NRC), Canada. The author adopted a hot-film anemometer to obtain the mean/fluctuating velocities and turbulence intensities data at different locations over the flight deck. The experiments were conducted at Reynolds number of 1.8 × 105 for three WOD conditions namely, headwind (00), Green 450 and Green 900. The author also conducted spectral analysis of vertical velocity fluctuations at several locations over the helodeck. The spectral analysis statistics revealed that most of the turbulent energy was in the range of 0.1–2 Hz, which is of the same order of magnitude as reported earlier by Healey [05]. However, the magnitude of the frequency range is relatively lower, possibly due to the simplified geometry and a lower turbulence intensity present in the experiments.

In 2005, Shafer and Ghee [65] investigated the periodic vortex behaviour of airwakes in the vicinity of ships. The vortices are generated due to the presence of a bluff body. It has been understood from the reported spatial and temporal velocity statistics that the motion of the vortices present in the vicinity of the ship governs the flow characteristics over the helodeck. They also anticipated that the vortex motion which governs the velocity spectra may lead to the creation of unfavourable unsteady flow conditions. Thus, the author investigated the scope of active and passive flow control modification to suppress the vortices over the helodeck. Experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel on a U.S. Navy Destroyer DDG-81 (1:144 scale) ship geometry with a single wire thermal probe. Different flow modification devices were used to assess the suitability of flow control over the helodeck. The authors reported that the active and passive flow control approach significantly improves the flow characteristics over the flight deck by suppressing/modifying the vortices motion. Overall, the study provides a fundamental understanding of the ship airwake.

In subsequent years, the researchers continued exploring the scope of flow control modification/device in detail. Findlay and Ghee [66] conducted experimental flow control modification on a US Navy Flight II-A Class Destroyer (DDG) (1:144 scale) ship. The prime objective of this study was to reduce the turbulence energy level over the flight deck. Similar to earlier studies, the authors used a hot-wire anemometer for spatial and temporal velocity statistics. Eleven different sets of configurations were attached to the roof and vertical edges of the helo-hangar. The authors stated that the possibility of such flow control modifications could be implemented based on three options namely, (i) modify the ship to improve the air wake, (ii) modify the helicopter to achieve better control in the airwake environment and (iii) improve the ship and aircraft operating procedures. Application of such flow control devices could be retrofitted into the existing naval ships in the form of removable appendages. Besides, they can also be installed particularly during the shipboard landing operations.

In general, most of the experimental studies have used impact probes or the thermal anemometry (hot-wire/hot-film) technique. The thermal anemometry gives adequate frequency response, but due to its intrusive application, the measurement and characterisation of spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously in three-dimensions are not feasible. Secondly, the signal to noise ratio is too low for thermal anemometry leading to reduced accuracy of measurements, especially near the ship helodeck region. Another limitation of the thermal anemometry approach is insensitivity to the flow direction. Thus, a single sensor cannot be used, as the instantaneous flow direction over the helodeck changes randomly due to the separated turbulent flow condition. Further, the correlations with separation in the direction of the mean velocity are also difficult to measure, because the wake of any probe inserted into the flow interferes with the flow across the downstream which leads to error in auto-correlation measurements [67].

Accurate measurements in the helodeck region can only be achieved by optical anemometry methods as well as precise non-intrusive auto-correlation measurements [13]. Introduction of laser technology in the early 1960's helped develop the optical anemometry methods. The Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA/LDV) in 1961, and more recently the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) (late 1980's), have been developed as non-intrusive quantitative methods for flow measurements. Both the methods overcome the limitation associated with the thermal anemometry. Besides, these approaches also offer the measurement and characterisation of spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously in three-dimensions. The accessibility of such three-dimensional correlations data would be very useful and reliable to input the exact flow conditions in the flight simulator and help to simulate the helicopter rotor plane.

In line with the previous flow control modification studies, Greenwell and Barrett [68] investigated a flow control modification on a generic TTCP SFS1 (1:90 scale) frigate ship geometry. The authors used different sets of inclined porous screens as a flow control device fitted at the ship helo-hangar door area. The prime objective behind such a specific placement was to reduce the turbulence levels as well as the vertical velocity gradient of the airwake over the flight deck area. It was the first reported attempt to use optical anemometry. A Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) was used for flow measurements in the speed range of 32 m/s to 55 m/s. The LDA technique is a nonintrusive optical measurement technique used to measure the velocity at a point of the flow. As recommended by Healey [5], the flow behaviour is independent of the Reynolds number, when Re ≥ 1.1 × 104 for wind tunnel testing of ships. However, the authors conducted experimental measurements at two Reynolds numbers 3.3 × 105 and 5.65 × 105 to verify the Reynolds number flow independence. Authors concluded that the two-flow modification screen fitted on the sides & roof of the hangar and inclined rearwards gave the best performance by minimising the turbulence levels as well as minimising the adverse velocity gradients of ship airwakes.

In 2010, Nacakli and Landman [69] used the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique for velocity measurements. This was the first use of PIV to investigate the ship airwake. The overarching aim of this study was to understand the ship airwakes and the rotor downwash phenomenon. The PIV experiments were conducted by employing a ship/rotor in isolation one by one and then coupled with other cases in order to compare the individual velocity fields to the coupled measurement. The authors performed experiments on a TTCP SFS1 (1:50 scale) model in a low-speed wind tunnel at two different velocity ratios (free stream velocity to tip velocity). The PIV flow field analysis was analysed over a set of longitudinal and lateral planes for headwind (WOD = 00) condition. Further, the rotor thrust measurements were also taken between each mentioned case and were statistically compared. Overall, the PIV analysis successfully identified regions over the helodeck which had statistically significant variations. Besides, this study also highlighted the changes in rotor thrust due to rotor downwash and frigate airwake interaction.

Mora's group [[70], [71], [72], [73]] conducted a series of experimental investigations on ship airwake aerodynamics. The experimental measurements were conducted at full-scale as well as model-scale. The overall goal of Mora's group included; (i) development of SHOL envelope for ship operations based on experimental data [70], (ii) evaluation of various measurement methods used to estimate the ship airwakes [71], (iii) assess the geometric features of ship superstructure to control the ship airwake [72] and (iv) investigate the active flow control technique for ship airwakes [73].

The full-scale wind velocity measurements were conducted using a three-component sonic anemometer. The anemometer was located on a mast, i.e. the helo-hangar top surface which is nearly 5 m above the helodeck level. Location of the full-scale anemometer point was tested in the model wind tunnel experiments. Reported results show good agreement between the model-scale wind tunnel and full-scale measurements. Further, the authors developed model and full-scale correlations based on the initial stage experimental database. Later, this correlation map was used to create a preliminary ship helicopter operating limit (SHOL) envelope for the specific version of the fabricated ship model. The SHOL envelope (see Fig. 11) is a polar plot which highlights the acceptable conditions of relative wind speed and wind direction for safe helicopter flight operation. There is a unique SHOL for every ship and helicopter flight operation. This map also covers the Deck Interface Pilot Effort Scale (DIPES) chart (see Fig. 12). The DIPES chart is a qualitative rating given by the ETP during the DI process. DIPES scale is a typical measure of the pilot workload or the level of control activity at different wind conditions which is highlighted in the SHOL envelope. Series of descriptor letters (short-hand letter) are provided as an indicator of various control activities, which help the pilot and ground staff to assess/guide. The complete landing activities and onboard conditions are synchronised through this map. Additionally, this map also indicates details about the day/night operation, max roll, and pitch of the ship [74].

Mora [71] investigated the efficacy of various velocity measurement methods used for capturing the ship airwakes. The investigation included three methods, namely, Oil film visualisation, LDV and PIV. The author conducted experiments on a TTCP SFS1 (1:50 scale) frigate model in a low-speed wind tunnel. Detailed comparisons of the above three mentioned approaches are discussed for various sets of WOD conditions. Results obtained by different methods were compared individually and validated with full-scale data. Overall, the comparisons showed that the simplified frigate geometry results predict the full-scale frigate ship flow reasonably well over a wide range of WOD conditions. Overall the study highlights the use of optical anemometry advantages over the conventional oil film visualisation.

Further, Mora and Meseguer [72] continued the assessment of the geometric features of ship superstructure. The main aim was to investigate the possibility of reducing/controlling the ship airwakes through geometric modifications. The authors proposed a modified SFS frigate geometry with curved shape helo-hangar roof. It was anticipated by the authors that the proposed modification might be helpful to keep the flow attached to the ship superstructure. Detailed parametric investigations were conducted through PIV method to optimise the radius of helo-hangar roof curvature. The authors reported that the effectiveness of the proposed modification reduced the length of the shear layer by 42% as compared to the baseline SFS1 geometry. However, the application of such a curved roof on a real warship is of significant concern, as the curved shapes on the ship may lead to deterioration of the ship's stealth features. At the same time due to lack of rules and regulations available in open source, the application of such superstructure modifications cannot be validated. Therefore, the successful implementation of such optimised flow control devices on the real ship is always critical and is a matter of further investigation. During our extensive literature survey, limited non-classified regulations/guidelines related to warship/offshore helodeck configurations are found which are listed in Table 3. These documents cover only limited guidelines related to aviation facilities for safe landing, system and markings details. No regulations/guidelines are listed which are associated with the helodeck superstructure modification.

In continuation of their previous work, Mora et al. [73] investigated plasma actuators as an active flow control technique for ship airwakes. The plasma actuators are electrical devices that generate a wall bounded jet without the use of any moving parts [75]. Thus, it can be used as a flow control device for aerodynamic applications to delay separation and increase lift on a wing. The authors used two different configurations of dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator as a flow control modification on SFS1 geometry. The plasma actuator was set on the helo-hangar wall, and the location of the placement was based on the guidelines of past studies [65,66,68]. A detailed PIV investigation was reported by the authors to demonstrate that the plasma actuator is a significant flow control modification device. This finding was consistent with the earlier studies on the flow control modifications were significant improvements in reducing/controlling the ship airwakes were reported. Overall, the reported PIV results showed that the proposed plasma actuators reduce flow unsteadiness and turbulence intensity over the helodeck.

Rosenfeld et al. [76] conducted wind tunnel experiments on three different scale models (1:100, 1:68 and 1:50) of SFS2 geometry. The scope of this investigation was to study; (i) impact of Reynolds number, and blockage effect on ship airwake (ii) physical modelling of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and its effect on ship wind loads, and (iii) scale and wall effects on ship airwake. The experiments were conducted in 8 × 10-foot NSWCCD wind tunnel at three WOD conditions (00, 600 and 900). The authors used a five-hole fast response probe (FRP) and a high-speed PIV method for measurements. The authors conducted experiments at several Reynolds number between 2.1 × 106–5.9 × 106 and found similarities between all the data sets, which implies that the flow is independent of Reynolds number. The airwake data showed significant sensitivity to the blockage effects. Blockage effect caused an apparent increment in the airwake load up to 13% for the beam winds. The wall effects were more predominantly seen in the 1:68 and 1:50 scale models. The authors recommended the use of a smaller ratio model for more accurate measurements. Similarly, the wall effects also increased mean airwake velocities by 15% for the beam wind case. Further, the authors claimed to have successfully simulated the ABL in the wind tunnel by use of a Cowdrey-type inlet grid system. Overall, the results showed good agreement between the FRP and PIV measurements. However, both the systems identified slight lateral asymmetry in the flow over the helodeck, which is analogous to the findings of Zan et al. [63]. The authors recommended Reynolds numbers value of 5 × 106 or higher (based on model length) to avoid scale effects on the airwakes.

Rahimpour and Oshkai [77] conducted the most recent work for ship airwake measurements using optical anemometry. The authors continued the work of Zan et al. [63] on the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) (1:522 scale) polar icebreaker with high-speed PIV. The investigations were done over a range of WOD conditions. The authors selected two different inlet boundary conditions namely, uniform flow and simulated atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow for wind tunnel experiments. All the measurements were conducted at three Reynolds numbers namely, 47900, 50500 and 61000. They found that the flow over the helodeck is independent of the Reynolds number which is consistent with the finding of Healey [5] and Greenwell and Barrett [68]. Further, they showed that the spatial structures of the airwake are strongly dependent on the WOD angle and the highest turbulence levels were reported over the helodeck region for 300° (600 Green) WOD angle.

All the reported references which have been gathered in the experimental ship airwake modelling review are summarised under two categories; (i) experimental studies based on mean-flow feature measurement of ship airwake in Table 4 and (ii) experimental studies based on transient-flow feature measurement of ship airwake in Table 5.

4. Computational modelling
It has been already discussed that the DI modelling represents massive challenges. However, the rapid development in the field of computing technology may permit the possibility of high-fidelity DI simulation in the near future. The approach of computational modelling seems apt because it can provide complete information about the flow over the entire helicopter flight path including helodeck. Due to this anticipation, the CFD has emerged as an essential tool for the ship airwake numerical studies. CFD can be used as a tool for the generation of the airwake data over the helodeck, and later this data can be used as input data for the flight simulators to simulate the helicopter path. Accessibility of such ship airwake and helicopter flight data can serve as reference data before actual DI testing is undertaken.

This section provides a review of various studies in the context of computational modelling of the ship airwake. Similar to the previous section, the review of computational modelling starts with an overview of popular numerical methods in CFD (Section 4.1) followed by the relevant governing parameters (Section 4.2) used in numerical modelling. The following sub-sections review the ship airwake modelling (Section 4.3) in detail.

4.1. Numerical methods
The study of turbulent flows and its numerical modelling became a vibrant research area after the inception of computing technology. The use of CFD has become an essential tool in the numerical analysis of complex fluid flow. There are different approaches which have been developed for solving turbulent flows using CFD. These approaches can be broadly categorised into three types: direct numerical simulation (DNS); large eddy simulation (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations.

The DNS method offers comprehensive details of the temporal and spatial scales of flow. It solves the governing equations for all scales of motion directly and does not require any model equations. Therefore, even for a simple flow problem (low Reynolds number), this approach requires a considerably high number of computational nodes and the consequent computational cost. At higher Reynolds number the flow contains a wide spectrum of turbulence scales, hence application of DNS in such scenarios is expected to be prohibitively very expensive. For example, the level of computational resources to resolve three-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence requires at least 109 grids at Re = 2 × 102 [78]. Thus, at present due to the substantial requirement of computational resources, this approach cannot be practical for high Reynolds number problems like a ship, where the order of Reynolds number is typically 107.

The LES approach can resolve the large eddies whereas, the smaller eddies are modelled using different sub-grid scale (SGS) models. As the method requires a combination of filtered and modelled equations, the computational requirements are relatively less as compared to DNS. In the current paradigm, it has been estimated that LES would nearly require 1011 grids to resolve a high Reynolds number flow of the order of 107 [79]. In contrast to DES, LES can be used with slightly coarser grid and relatively larger time steps. The convenience of such flexibility is adopted in LES through the wall-function approximation in the subgrid-scale model, where shear stress at the wall is modelled with some relaxation of grids at a near-wall resolution [80]. Overall, in the present context, the usage of LES is practical but not an affordable tool at the early design stage wherein numerous parametric simulations are required.

The RANS method numerically solves the averaged quantities of the flow field using time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. This method models all scales of turbulence, i.e. the instantaneous velocity field can be decomposed into its mean 
(time-averaged) and fluctuating components (
), such that, 
. Therefore, the time averaging of the Navier-Stokes equations leads to extra terms, known as the Reynolds stresses (−
), which need to be modelled. For more details on RANS method formulation see Ref. [81]. In contrast to DNS and LES, this method is computationally less expensive. Due to the advantage of computational cost-effectiveness, a considerable number of RANS based models have been developed over the last few decades and widely used for parametric analysis in various industries. However, these models are not universally accepted and hence have to be validated against the experimental database for better accuracy and reliability. Involvement of several arbitrary coefﬁcients in RANS-based models affects the accuracy/prediction. As a result, an optimised turbulence model for one ﬂow region may not provide accurate results in some other area. Thus, validation with the experimental database is necessary.

Features based on a brief comparison of DNS, LES and RANS methods are presented in Table 6. In the present context, the development of efficient numerical techniques is one of the popular research trends in the CFD domain. The prime objective of developing such methods is to achieve the solution close/equivalent to experiments at relatively less computational cost. In the last one decade, several numerical methods have been devolved to bridge the gap between the LES and RANS approach namely; hybrid LES-RANS based models; Detached Eddy Simulation (DES), see details [82], hybrid URANS/Vorticity Transport method [83] and Partially-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (PANS) [84].

4.2. Governing numerical parameters
Similar to the previous section, in this section we summarise several numerical parameters which play a critical role in regulating the numerical method accuracy and stability. These parameters are often termed as governing numerical parameters. To make the summary insightful and concise, we reviewed only those parameters which are frequently used in the numerical modelling of ship-helo Dynamic Interface (DI).

4.2.1. Non-dimensional governing numbers
i)
Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy Number (CFL) - The CFL number is a necessary condition for the convergence. It is a non-dimensional number, which highlights the consistency of given flow speed and timestep at the corresponding grid size, see details [85]. In other words, the CFL number takes into account implicit or explicit time integration schemes to ensure that the given time step must be less than an absolute limit. Otherwise, the numerical solver may lead towards the numerical instability and does not achieve the convergence. Thus, it is an excellent measure to select an appropriate time-step/time interval for numerical simulations.


The general CFL condition for the n-dimensional case is as follows;
(9)
where, 
 is the flow velocity, 
 is the length interval and 
 is the time step. For an explicit solver, typically CFLmax = 1, whereas, implicit solvers are usually less sensitive to numerical instability and so larger values of CFLmax up to 5 may be used.
ii)
Reynolds Number (Re) - It is a dimensionless number which characterises the relative importance of inertial and viscous forces in a particular flow. For the case of ship,

(10)Re = ρ.U.L/μ
where, ρ and μ denote the density and dynamic viscosity of the ﬂuid, and U and L the velocity and characteristics length of the ship (either ship beam or ship length), respectively.
iii)
Strouhal Number (St) - It is a dimensionless number that characterises the oscillating flow phenomena such as vortex shedding.

(11)
where f is a natural shedding frequency, l is a characteristic body dimension, and U is the free stream velocity.

The frequency at which vortices are shed from the body is called the “natural” shedding frequency. For, bluff bodies such as square or rectangular cylinders, St lies between 0.15 and 0.3 for different flow regimes [86], whereas, for a ship St lies in the range of 0.16–0.25 [07, 50, 56]. Typically, the Strouhal number is a function of the body shape and the Reynolds number between 20 < Re < 20,000. However, at relatively high Reynolds numbers the vortex shedding does not occur at a single distinct frequency but rather over a narrow band of frequencies [87]. Thus, the Strouhal number is a function of the body shape only.

4.2.2. Solver parameters
i)
Discretisation Methods - The choice of discretisation scheme has an important role in the accuracy and effectiveness of the computational modelling. In the context of CFD, researchers have used different solver methods namely, ﬁnite-difference, ﬁnite-volume, and spectral methods, for numerical studies of ship airwakes. Typically, the ﬁnite difference methods and spectral methods are more accurate than the corresponding ﬁnite-volume methods for simple geometries. Earlier attempts of numerical modelling of ship airwakes used either ﬁnite-difference or a combination of ﬁnite-difference and spectral methods [55]. However, the latest trend is to use the ﬁnite-volume method due to ease of handling complex ship geometries and availability of commercial ﬁnite-volume packages in different organisations. In the finite-volume method, there are numerous spatial and temporal numerical schemes which are used by the solvers. The selection of an appropriate scheme for solver depends on the idea of circumventing the numerical dissipation and the numerical instabilities. Therefore, selection of an appropriate scheme for a particular geometry or a specific flow depends on the resolution of the numerical solvers. For spatial and time discretisation both implicit and explicit schemes and their combinations have been explored in ship airwake modelling.

ii)
y plus (y+) - It is defined as a non-dimensional wall distance for a wall-bounded flow. It is commonly used as a benchmark for wall treatment/resolving during numerical modelling [88]. The relation between the non-dimensional velocity (u+) and non-dimensional wall distance (y+) defines the turbulence flow feature in the vicinity of the wall. Based on u+ and y+ relation the near wall region can be classified into three zones namely, (a) viscous-sub layer, where molecular effects govern the flow; (b) buffer layer, where molecular as well as turbulent both govern the flow; (c) fully turbulent layer, where the turbulent effects solely govern the flow phenomena, see details [89].

(12)
(13)
(14)
(15)
where, 
 is the wall characteristic velocity or friction velocity, 
 is the wall shear stress, y is the distance to the wall, 
 is the fluid density, 
is dynamic and kinematic viscosity respectively.
iii)
Grid Distribution - Grid distribution is a critical parameter on which numerical results simulated are dependent. The distribution of a grid is crucial to resolve/capture the flow efficiently with the acceptable compromise between accuracy and computational cost. The grid should be distributed finer in critical regions, such as, behind the helo-hangar, wake region of helodeck and ship surfaces, where the flow separation and reattachments can occur [74]. Besides, it is also necessary to resolve the walls for the case of wall-bounded flow over the helodeck so that the distribution of the grid can capture the inertial subrange, and resolve the near wall regions.


However, it has been found that the ship airwake flow is mainly inertia-driven and the separation points are fixed by the sharp edges rather than caused by boundary layer separation. The measure of an appropriate grid distribution for such problems is done based on y+ criteria. Forrest et al. [74] have given a comprehensive prior-meshing criterion for wall-bounded ship helodeck ﬂows, which requires normalised grid spacing Δ/h ≤ 8.33 × 10−2 with y+ ≤ 10, where Δ is grid spacing, h is hangar height, and y+ is non-dimensional wall distance, respectively. Though, it is always suggested to conduct a grid independence study to verify the influence of grid distribution on the simulated results.
iv)
Time-Step (Δt) – The choice of suitable time step is essential to minimise the time-integration errors in any unsteady numerical analysis. The specified time-step must be small enough such that it permits the natural evolution of unsteady flow features within the domain. According to the Nyquist criterion in signal processing, there must be a sufficient number of time-steps within the signal cycle to resolve the dominant frequencies [90]. On the contrary, the choice of a too small time-step leads to significant increase in the physical time as well as the computational cost [74]. Also, if the choice of time-step is relatively high, then it may affect the stability of numerical schemes.


From the point of view of numerical schemes stability, the estimation of appropriate time-step is a very crucial task. Like the case of explicit schemes, the time-step independence test has been often conducted to check the solution sensitivity and accuracy. However, such time-step testing is not required for implicit time advancement scheme due to its absolute stability regardless of time-step size. In contrast to explicit schemes, the implicit time advancement scheme is computationally expensive.

The standard approach to calculate a suitable time-step is suggested by Spalart [82] that the local Courant-Freidrichs-Lewy (CFL) number should be equal to 1. In other words, this condition implies that the smallest eddies allowed by the local grid spacing can be convected by the time advancement scheme with a similar level of error to the spatial discretisation error.

Another approach has been suggested by Forrest et al. [74] that for flows which exhibit coherent shedding (e.g. a 2D cylinder), a minimum of 20 time-steps per shedding period should be used. As already explained in previous sections, the flow phenomenon over the ship helodeck is very different as compared to the 2D cylinder. The flow past a ship consists of turbulence with a wide range of length and time-scales, leading to a dominant frequency range rather than a definite peak. The reported dominant frequency range for ship airwakes is in the range of 1–10 Hz [03, 13, 62, 64]. As per the suggested recommendations, considering 1 Hz as the upper bound of the dominant full-scale frequency range and permitting 20 time-steps per period, the suggested time-step of an unsteady ship airwake simulation is 1/20 s, approximately.

4.2.3. Computational domain and boundary conditions
4.2.3.1. Computational Domain
In general, the computational domain size is decided based on the idea of less blockage ratio (frontal area of model/cross-section area of test section). In other words, it is implied that the domain size must be large enough to accommodate the ship geometry and isolate the effect of the surrounding flow disturbance. The choice of domain size has a substantial impact on the accuracy and the cost of computation. For the case of ship airwake computations, the streamwise and transverse direction domain length is relatively very crucial, and is dependent on the characteristic geometric features such as length, width, and height. Besides, it also depends on the types of boundary conditions adopted in a particular study. For example, for the case of convective outﬂow boundary condition, the streamwise domain length should be sufficiently long so that there must not be any reverse ﬂow at the boundary. Similarly, the transverse domain length is decided based on the WOD inflow condition.

Interestingly, the literature review reveals that for a similar kind of ship geometry, computational domain sizes can vary. It has also been found that the past studies investigated different ship geometries (see, Table 7), and hence the computational domain size varied. Besides, it is observed that the different computational domain shapes (rectangular, semi-cylindrical and cylindrical) are reported in the literature (see, Table 8). However, the selection of rectangular shape domain has frequently been used in various computational studies. The choice of rectangular shape domain seems to be more logical since the ship helodeck geometry has similar box shape superstructures. Further, the rectangular shape domain is consistent with a typical wind tunnel cross-section.

4.2.3.2. Boundary Conditions
Summary of different boundary conditions which has been reported in various computational studies is discussed in this section. Overall, there are five boundary conditions which have been frequently used in literature for numerical ship airwake modelling. These boundary conditions are discussed here.

4.2.3.2.1. Inlet/inflow
The computational domain inlet condition affects the inﬂow characteristics in ship airwake ﬂows. An inaccurate speciﬁcation of flow direction can lead to incorrect predictions of ﬂow characteristics. For DNS, LES and RANS, the inﬂow boundary conditions are unsteady and need correct speciﬁcation concerning both mean velocity and turbulent ﬂuctuations. One of the straightforward methods to generate inlet condition is to use the mean velocity proﬁle with and without ABL and add turbulence perturbations to it [91]. Later, Reddy et al. [92] reported that the above-stated method of inﬂow generation provides a good measure of ship airwake turbulence in their numerical study. Afterwards, this boundary condition has been adopted frequently by many researchers in numerical studies [[91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115], [116]]. In another approach, the inflow boundary condition is specified using a uniform far field pressure with a free-stream Mach number along with turbulence perturbations [74,118,119,[121], [122], [123],133].

4.2.3.2.2. Outlet/outﬂow
The inaccurate specification of outlet conditions affects ﬂow gradients at the outer boundary and leads to the convergence issues. Thus, the outflow boundary condition also requires correct speciﬁcation in a computational method. For the case of ship airwake flows, most researchers have used a pressure boundary condition at the outlet of the computational domain [[91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115], [116]]. However, others have used a convective outﬂow boundary condition [124,127].

4.2.3.2.3. Sea and ship surface
The no-slip wall boundary condition is applied to the ship [[91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115], [116], [117], [118], [119], [120], [121], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129], [130], [131], [132], [133]]. The sea surface is assigned a slip condition in the case of uniform velocity profile. Otherwise, a rough surface with wall function is assigned for the case of ABL velocity profile [74].

4.2.3.2.4. Outer domain
The outer domain boundary is modelled either by slip condition with zero specified shear or as a moving wall with a velocity equal to the wind at the boundary height [[91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101]].

4.2.3.2.5. Symmetry
Several researchers have used symmetry boundary condition to reduce the computational costs through modelling half portion of the ship [91,101].

Finally, the list of various ship geometries with a tabulated summary of Reynolds number, Turbulence model, Computational Domain, Grid Size of ship airwakes flow is presented in Table 7, Table 8, respectively. Similarly, a list of initial boundary conditions adopted in various ship airwake literature is presented in Table 9.

4.3. Ship airwake modelling
Computational investigations on ship airwake characteristics were started way back in the 1970's. Till that time, the challenges associated with ship airwake aerodynamics had been well documented, and early experimental investigations had already started. However, the limitations related to stand-alone dynamic interface experimental modelling remained intact. These limitations were the prime motivation behind starting the ship airwake numerical modelling. The researchers had anticipated the possibilities of high-fidelity and real-time stand-alone ship airwake investigation through the numerical modelling approach. Also, the rapid development of the computational facilities during that era also promoted the numerical modelling approach.

The early stage of numerical modelling of ship airwake started with the simplified equations (empirical relations) which were derived by analytical methods. The first reported instance of measured ship airwake data used to create a numerical program was proposed by Fortenbaugh [55]. This airwake model was an analytical model and applied to investigate the DE-1052 class ship (later redesigned as FF-1052) airwakes. Development of the FF-1052 airwake model was based on Garnett's experimental investigations [07]. The prime objective behind the development of this model was to imitate the experimental measurements of flow around a 1:50 scale model of an FF-1052 frigate. The author assumed representation of full-scale turbulence with second-order-filtered noise i.e. the noise level indicates the energy spectrum of random turbulent fluid motion. Later, the authors proposed the airwake model for a DD-963 destroyer [134,135] based on their initial FF-1052 airwake model. He assumed that the superstructures of the DD-963 and FF-1052 were similar enough so that the geometric scaling could be used to make the measurements for the FF-1052 applicable to the DD-963. However, the above assumption was questioned by several researchers, since the shapes of the two ships were noticeably different. Later, it was also found that the levels of simulated turbulence were not similar and they were relatively very high as compared to Garnett's [61] experimental data. The difference of turbulence level may be because the airwake velocities were applied to the helicopter rotor disk with the assumption that the presence of the aircraft model did not alter the airwake. Another reason for such deviation could be that the proposed airwake model was limited to steady flow only, and was not capable of considering any unsteady airwake effects. Thus, the rapid change in location of separation points could not be captured by the airwake model.

Nave [136] continued Fortenbaugh's [134,135] approach and developed two analytical airwake models from fast frigate CVA & FF-1052 ship geometry to analyse the shipboard launch and recovery dynamics of conventional VTOL aircraft. The author adopted Fortenbaugh's [55] model and suggested a change in the random airwake components. In contrast to Fortenbaugh [55], the random airwake components were generated using first-order-filtered noise rather than second-order noise. The proposed modified model was analytically validated against the wind tunnel data in terms of spectra measurements. Moreover, it was also observed that the modified model improves the accuracy and reduces the complexity of the mathematical modelling. The author has also suggested the idea of ‘Strouhal number scaling’ instead of conventional geometric scaling to calculate the full-scale turbulent frequency through model-scale data. The proposed ‘Strouhal number scaling’ relation to correlate the full-scale frequency with wind speed is given as;
(16)
where, 
 is the full-scale shedding frequency in Hz and 
is free-stream velocity in feet/sec. Introduction of Strouhal number scaling is very useful, particularly in the case, where additional wind tunnel data is unavailable. For such cases, the model data may be applied to full-scale ships having a similar geometry or the same ship at different velocities by merely applying Strouhal number scaling. However, this approach was not tested with a flight simulator due to the unavailability of such technology in that era. Thus, the validity of Strouhal number scaling for ship-helicopter coupled environment is undetermined. Overall, the modified model showed that the random number noise generators could improve the agreement to measured velocity spectra by reducing the high frequency content.

Encouraging agreement and successful execution of analytical ship airwake model with full-scale and wind -tunnel data has supported the development of high-fidelity CFD simulation programs. The standard feature of all the early stage numerical programs was based on analytical method. Thus, its application was limited and was not possible to achieve the high-fidelity, real-time simulation of DI. Alongside, significant efforts have been invested by the researchers to develop efficient and cost-effective numerical discretisation methods. Till 1980's, two discretisation methods namely, finite difference method (FDM) and finite volume method (FVM) were commonly used in CFD. However, the use of the finite difference discretisation method in ship airwake numerical modelling was limited, and the finite volume method was in the development phase. In the next one decade, the FVM earned popularity among researchers and turned out to be one of the most versatile discretisation techniques in CFD. Further, the scarcity of high-speed computational resources during initial stages necessitated the use of the steady RANS method for CFD modelling.

In 1993, Tai and Carico [91], reported the first use of a FVM based CFD code to investigate the ship airwakes by using a multi-zone, thin-layer Navier-Stokes method. The study numerically investigates the simplified 1:140 scale DD-963 ship configuration through the application of NASA Langley's CFL3D code with Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model at two-wind speeds; 5 m/s and 15 m/s. Both simulations were performed for 30° WOD condition on model-scale and full-scale, respectively. The NASA Ames 3DGRAPE code was used for grid generation. A cylindrical grid topology was adopted to capture the flow across the sharp edges. A moderately coarse grid was adopted with grid points 99 × 59 × 51 in streamwise, lateral and radial direction, respectively. The authors justified the selection of a coarse grid due to the relatively low-speed freestream inlet condition assigned for simulation. The authors simulated only half of ship, (i.e. starboard side of the ship) by considering the symmetry about the center plane and achieved a two-fold reduction in the computation time. Both laminar and turbulent flow conditions were simulated. Overall, the model-scale numerical results show a similar trend with the Johns and Healey [7] wind-tunnel experimental data. However, a slight disagreement was observed between the model and full-scale CFD results. Results highlighted that the resulting airwake flow contains regions of massive flow separation along with free vortices. The key flow features including viscous-vortex interactions observed in the wind tunnel experiments were captured accurately by CFD.

Later in 2000, Reddy et al. [92] performed steady RANS CFD computations over the full-scale TTCP SFS1 geometry. Simulations were performed at 0°, 45° and 90° WOD conditions using the RNG k-ε turbulence model with the commercial Navier-Stokes solver FLUENT. Presented results highlighted the effect of the vertical velocity component and of the recirculation region over the flight deck. Qualitative validation of the CFD prediction was also performed by the author with the ship helodeck flow visualisation data reported by Zan [57]. In contrast to Tai and Carico [91], the authors conducted a grid sensitivity study using six different grids in the range of 56,000 to 14,75,136 cells and demonstrated the variation of the velocity field with respect to grid density. Observations show that the numerical results are very sensitive to the size of the grid. Thus, a reasonably fine grid is necessary to capture the flow field over the helodeck correctly. Overall, it is seen that the numerical predictions captured the general flow characteristics of the steady-state ship airwake reasonably well and the trends matched well with the flow visualisation data with a slight difference in the location of reattachment point and vortices.

Subsequently, Tai [93] also investigated the SFS1 model and proposed modifications based on the shortcoming of the SFS1 frontal structure. In accordance with the conclusion drawn by Reddy et al. [91], Tai also adopted a fine grid with 1.2 million structured cells. In contrast to the original SFS1 results, the flow over the modified SFS remained attached due to the geometry of the curved bow and the flow only gets separated from the helo-hangar walls. A noteworthy difference was seen between Tai's [93] and Reddy et al. [91] results. The author has not given any explanation for the disagreement in results. Later, Yesilel and Edis [94] numerically investigated the ship airwakes on both the TTCP models (SFS1 and SFS2) at several WOD conditions in quest to examine the differences between both the generic models. The authors compared the TTCP model airwakes flow physics to highlight the key differences. They found that the flow over SFS1 was highly separated as compared to the SFS2 model due to the rectangular bow.

In 2004, Syms [95] conducted a combined numerical and experimental investigation on the airwake characteristics nearby the flight deck of a frigate ship. For experimental investigation a 1:50 scale model of Canadian Patrol Frigate (CPF) was used, whereas, the numerical investigations were done on the simplified CPF. The author mentioned that the choice for a simplified version CPF model is mainly to avoid the complexities associated with the actual CPF geometry structures. Computations were carried out using the structured multi-block flow solver ‘CFD-ACE’ code using the k-ε turbulence model. The author used the wall function approach to resolve the flow in the vicinity of the wall. Overall, the results show that the numerical solution captures the flow structures over the flight deck reasonably well, but the flow contains relatively higher spatial gradients. Further, the author concluded that the flow over the helodeck is highly unstable in nature due to the presence of such differences in the spatial gradients. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the complexity attributed to the unsteadiness of airwakes.

Moat et al. [96] used the CFD approach to investigate the effects of the ship superstructures airwake. They anticipated that the wind speed measurements obtained from ship-mounted anemometers are often influenced by the distortion of the airflow/smoke in the vicinity of the ship's stake and superstructure. Due to this reason, the accurate measurement of wind condition over the ship represents a crucial task. Accurate measurements of wind condition are necessary because these wind speed measurements are used in SHOL envelope prediction. Therefore, it is extremely important to know the relative wind over deck conditions as accurately as possible. The authors conducted three-dimensional numerical studies of the mean airflow over different research ships and a generic tanker/bulk carrier. The CFD simulations were performed using the VECTIS code. VECTIS is a commercial finite volume three-dimensional Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes solver having second-order accuracy. The authors intended to reproduce the steady-state mean flow characteristics and did not study the turbulence structures. Two turbulence models namely, standard k-ε and RNG k-ε were used. The authors found that the k-ε RNG model is accurate with higher order turbulence models in studying the mean airflow over the bluff body. To resolve the wall boundary condition, authors adopted a standard wall function approach. The y+ value was varied between 35 and 300 in the computational domain with the number of grid cells being in the range of 2 × 105 to 6 × 105. Results show that the airwake separates at the upwind leading edge of the bridge (superstructure over the helo-hangar) and a region of severely recirculated flow exists close to the bridge. The authors reported that the error in the wind speed measurement is highly dependent on the ship appendages and anemometer positions. Even at the well-exposed locations for anemometers, the wind speed measurements may be biased up to 10%. The authors also recommended that the best location of anemometers for wind measurements could be at or above the helo-hangar.

In 2007, Kulkarni et al. [97] reported the first study on the interaction behaviour of the engine intakes and exhaust smoke with the ship superstructure. The authors' focus was on ingestion, recirculation, and interaction of hot exhaust gases which are brought down to the ship's deck. They conducted state of the art wind tunnel experiments followed by a steady RANS numerical simulation. The prediction of wind speed and ﬂow path of exhaust plume from the ship stake is highly challenging [96], due to the fact that the whole phenomenon is aﬀected by a large number of parameters. These parameters are: (i) wind velocity, (ii) wind direction, (iii) level of turbulence, (iv) geometric structures on ship's deck and (v) exhaust velocity of smoke. To investigate the above-listed parameters, the authors conducted a parametric numerical investigation of the smoke plume flow characteristics on representative topside conﬁgurations of a generic frigate. The parametric study was performed with a total of 112 diﬀerent variants by varying WOD direction and velocity ratios for four superstructure conﬁgurations. The turbulence closure was achieved by using the standard k–ε turbulence model. Overall, the study provides crucial inputs of combined effects of exhaust smoke and ship airwake flow characteristics under diﬀerent operating conditions. The parametric study also demonstrated that CFD is a powerful tool to analyse the problem of exhaust smoke–superstructure interaction on ships and is capable of providing insightful input at an early design stage of a ship.

Later in 2011, Park et al. [98] conducted a numerical investigation on a ship's exhaust-gas flow and its application to improve the antenna location of a ship. Typically, the INMARSAT-C antenna plays a vital role in transmitting information during emergency conditions like main engine trouble, rainstorms and especially pirate raids. However, the exhaust smoke gas of a ship contains relatively high-temperature heat which affects the antenna performance and damages the effectiveness of the antenna. Besides, the exhaust smoke also decreases the visibility over the helodeck area and strongly affects the helicopter manoeuvring from the deck. Therefore, a better location for the smoke mast is very crucial for ship design. The authors carried out wind tunnel experiments followed by numerical simulation with 1:200 scale model of a 6000 TEU container carrier to investigate the smoke dispersal from the stack. Afterwards, a full-scale sea trial was also conducted to measure the temperature profile across the antenna through resistance-bulb-type temperature sensors. Overall, the complete set of both the results were compared and it was found that the relocation of the antenna was very useful. Also, the relocation showed substantial temperature drops on the antenna and helped maintained the efficacy of the mast. Later, Paul [99] continued a similar kind of investigation and studied the unsteady impact of ship airwakes on mast effectiveness in detail. Overall, both studies highlight a complicated part of smoke nuisance and their adverse effect on the ship-helicopter onboard operations.

In 2014, Shukla et al. [100] performed the full-scale numerical investigation of a flow modification device for both the generic TTCP frigate ship (SFS1 and SFS2). This is in line with the idea of an active and passive flow modifications approach highlighted in the past literature [65], [66], [68], [73]. The investigations were conducted at four different velocity ratios with the steady RANS approach. The authors did a series of parametric studies and identified three optimal flow modification configurations; (i) rotating cylinder (ii) flapping plate and (iii) side wall arc slots as active flow control device. To resolve the near wall flow characteristics, the authors adopted a standard wall function approach. The y + value varied between 30 and 100 in the computational domain with the number of grid cells varying between 1.4 × 106 to 2.5 × 106. Results show that adding a flow control device on a ship can effectively reduce the recirculation zone. It also limits the dominant turbulence intensity over the flight deck region. The authors reported that the k-ε RNG model showed better performance with the wall function approach in studying the ship airwake characteristics which is consistent with the Reddy et al. [92], Moat et al. [96] and Kulkarni et al. [97] findings. Further, the authors claimed that reduction in recirculation region and turbulence intensity would undoubtedly lead towards a decrease in the pilot workload and increase in the SHOL margin. Overall, the study shows that a flow control device can be used to control the complex flow behaviour during DI operation.

Praveen et al. [101] undertook an experimental and numerical investigation to understand the ship airwake characteristics over the helodeck region. They conducted studies on a 1:100 scale model of modified TTCP SFS2 frigate geometry. They experimentally mapped the flow-field using a five-hole probe. The flow field was also mapped qualitatively using smoke flow visualisation to get the insight into the vortices formation. The study brought out essential comparisons of the length of recirculation region for different hangar variants. They also found that the variation of a vertical and axial component of velocity is strongly affected by the shape of the hangar geometry configuration. Moreover, the vertical velocity component governs the helicopter flight stability and affect the downwash of the rotor. Overall, the study represents a useful benchmark data that can be used for quantitative and qualitative validation of the CFD simulations of the ship airwakes over a helodeck.

Even though numerous studies have been performed using steady RANS simulations, the assumption of a steady-state solution in the numerical analyses has been identified as a shortcoming in capturing the unsteadiness of the airwakes [95]. The steady flow modelling approach is based on the assumption that the ﬂow is statistically stationary and hence does not provide real-time airwake data. All the past literature on experimental modelling also confirms that the ship airwake flow over the helodeck region consists of large-scale coherent structures, counter-rotating vortices and is highly unsteady. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for unsteady flow simulations for high-fidelity DI modelling. Consequently, the research trends have shifted towards unsteady CFD simulations. Also, the accessibility of parallel CFD computing resources in late 2000 and adequate foundation encouraged to undertake the unsteady ship airwakes flow-field investigations. The upcoming sub-sections review various unsteady ship airwake numerical modelling methodologies in detail.

The first attempt for unsteady ship airwake numerical modelling was reported by Long et al. [102] in 1998. The proposed study involves the high order time-accurate ship airwake numerical investigations. To reduce the burden of unsteady modelling and computational cost, the authors developed a unique numerical method based on the nonlinear disturbance equations (NLDE) along with an inviscid CFL3D CFD solver. Inclusions of NLDE terms is to take care of the unsteady perturbation related properties, and it also facilitates fourth-order accuracy in space as well as in time. A full-scale SFS1 ship geometry was used to investigate the unsteady ship airwake flow characteristics. The solver first solves the steady-state solution. Subsequently, the unsteady components are obtained through steady-state field data using the NLDE implementation. The authors also demonstrated the first use of the parallel processing (Message Passing Interface - MPI) technique for efficient data distribution among processors. Overall, the comparison between the computed mean flow results revealed the similar flow topology, which has been reported by Healey [62]. However, there is a slight variation on the surface velocity vectors possibly due to the assumption of inviscid approach. Despite this variation, the results of the NLDE simulations show that significant unsteady perturbations exist over the helodeck.

In 2000–01, Polsky and Bruner [103,104] reported a collaborative research work called “Joint Ship Helicopter Integration Process (JSHIP) Program” in association with the US Navy Naval Air Warfare Center/Aircraft Division (NAVAIR). This program primarily focused on the investigation of unsteady airwake characteristics of a landing helicopter assault (LHA) class ship. They simulated several wind-over-deck (WOD) airwake conditions over an LHA class ship and emphasised the importance of flow scaling criteria for simulations. The flow scaling is essential for unsteady flow characteristics. However, inconsistent flow scaling could result in a wrong estimation of dominant frequency. In other words, the moderate frequency which exists at full-scale may scale up to a much higher frequency at model-scale experiments and lead to the wrong estimation. Thus, for effective flow scaling, they suggested Reynolds number scaling criteria. The computations were performed with the parallel unstructured Navier-Stokes solver COBALT using Monotone Integrated Large Eddy Simulation (MILES). The choice of MILES turbulence modelling is preferred over the traditional RANS turbulence model because MILES modelling is a scale resolving method. On the other hand, the RANS approach averages out all the flow scales resulting in poor prediction of mean quantity. This study was the first to use unstructured grid topology for ship airwake CFD studies. The size of the grids was of the order of 4 million. The advantage of unstructured grid topology permits efficient use of grid distribution with body-fitted bunching around the ship and maintains better aspect ratios in the computational domain. A suitable time step of 0.01 s based on Nyquist and CFL criteria was chosen to resolve frequencies up to 40 Hz. Results showed reasonable agreement between the experimental and computational data. Further, they also compared the steady and unsteady CFD results and found that the steady-state solution does not give the identical results as the time-averaged solutions. Further, they also found that the airwake flow field structure did not modify much at different wind speeds and they claimed that after the Reynolds number scaling, both the full and model scale time-averaged unsteady CFD results were observed to be similar for any combination of WOD conditions. Moreover, the results also highlight the general flow characteristics of the airwake that changed dramatically as the WOD angle changed. Therefore, the WOD condition indeed is a crucial parameter to assess the airwake flow pattern over the ship flight deck.

Sharma and Long [105] conducted a similar inviscid unsteady computation for the San Antonio class landing platform dock-17 (LPD-17) ship. In contrast to Polsky and Bruner [103,104] the authors used the Parallel Unstructured Maritime Aerodynamics (PUMA) solver without turbulence modelling. The principal aim of this investigation was to predict the non-periodic vortex shedding frequency of a large-scale ship structure. They numerically investigated the unsteady airwakes at two WOD conditions; 00 and 300 respectively. The wind tunnel experiments were conducted on a 1:94 model scale LPD-17 ship at the Naval Surface Warfare Center. Despite the absence of turbulence modelling, they claimed a reasonably good agreement between the experimental and computational data. However, they saw that the CFD simulations slightly under-predicted the size of the wake. The reason behind the underpredicated trends might be the selection of a very small time-step for relatively courser grids. The frequency spectra of transverse and vertical velocity show that the dominant non-dimensional vortex shedding frequency is in the range of Strouhal number of 0.2–0.25.

In continuation of the previous work [102,105], Sezer-Uzol et al. [106] performed a comprehensive assessment of LHA and LPD17 class ship airwakes. They used the latest version of inviscid CFD code ‘PUMA2’ instead of CFL3D (a structured solver) and PUMA (an unstructured solver). The advantage of PUMA2 is that it supports hybrid grids, i.e. (structured + unstructured). The argument given to justify inviscid flow approximation is that the airwake flow is independent of Reynolds number. Thus, the flow separation point will remain at a fixed location regardless of the flow being laminar or turbulent. Based on their steady-state and time-accurate full-scale investigations for a wind speed of 15.43 m/s (30 knots) at six different WOD conditions, they showed that the 30° WOD condition generates airwake fluctuations at a significantly higher magnitude leading to higher levels of spectral energy compared to head wind condition. Peak airwake frequencies for the LHA were generally in the range of 0.1–0.5 Hz, whereas, the LPD-17 class ship (a smaller ship) showed multiple peaks; first at 0.2 Hz frequency and the second at 0.5 Hz for both the WOD cases. They justified the occurrence of the first peak due to the vortex shedding frequency of the aft mast and the second peak due to the vortex shedding frequency from the edge of the hangar on the starboard side. Overall, the study gives detailed insight into the significant time-varying flow effects over the flight deck landing of two differently sized LHA and LPD-17 ships. The study also highlighted the significant temporal and spatial variation that could be responsible for additional pilot workload during DI. Guillot [107,108] also did a similar unsteady airwake computations on the LPD17 class ship using the FAST3D code. A comparison of mean velocity magnitudes at 0° and 30° WOD angles showed reasonable agreement. His findings are consistent with the Pennsylvania State research group [102,105,106] conclusions.

In 2002, Bogstad et al. [109] undertook inviscid CFD airwake modelling for the UK Royal Navy (RN), wherein airwakes for six RN ships were computed using the Finite Element Navier-Stokes Analysis Package (FENSAP). This was the first use of a finite element discretisation technique in CFD for ship airwake numerical modelling. The resulting data was used as look-up table for a ship airwake module in the RN Merlin simulator. Results for a Canadian Patrol Frigate (CPF) at headwind were compared with the corresponding wind tunnel data showing that agreement is reasonably appropriate with mean velocities. Moreover, the authors described the process of implementing the aerodynamic databases on the flight simulator for training purposes. It was the first instance when a high-fidelity numerical simulation was used with the flight simulator to simulate the pilot conditions. The ETPs feedback about the fidelity of resulting airwake simulation was extremely positive. Specific critical areas of the flow-field required the manual scaling of turbulence levels to meet the pilot's anticipated workload. Zan [110] criticized the approach adopted by Bogstad et al. [109] and questioned the basis of using a combination of accurate Euler solutions with unsteadiness generated by the flow gradients. Later, on this ground, he also questioned the acceptability of the Bogstad et al. [109] study, since the authors investigated a single WOD angle (headwind) only. The reported study could not be considered as a complete validation of the flight simulator approach until the different sets of WOD conditions are investigated by the same method. He also questioned the fidelity of a steady-state airwake database which was used for a turbulence model that required ‘adjustments’ based on pilot feedback. Till that time, it was already acknowledged in the past literature that the behaviour of the ship airwake is highly unsteady and its unsteadiness nature is strongly associated with the pilot workload. Therefore, the necessity of incorporating the unsteady turbulence into the solver is essential for a high-fidelity flight simulation of ship airwakes. Hence, the correct representation in the simulator of the unsteady airwake must be routed through the unsteady Navier–Stokes solution.

Till early 2010, the researchers had developed a good understanding of ship airwake numerical modelling. Also, it was clearly understood that there is a definite need for improved and efficient unsteady numerical modelling method for the high-fidelity DI simulations. Availability of such method would allow resolving the DI flow phenomena and offer more detailed insights into the flow dynamics. In line with this idea, Syms [111] was the first who presented a new approach “Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM)” for time-accurate numerical computations of ship airwakes. The author analysed the airwakes of both the TTCP simplified-frigate shapes. The LBM method based PowerFLOW solver works on the extended lattice gas method which is a discrete form of kinetic gas theory and can operate at the microscopic or mesoscopic scale. It is based on the sequence of particle steering and collisions. Results showed a qualitatively similar surface flow field for both geometries during validation against the oil flow visualisation by Cheney and Zan [57]. The author also showed the vortices locations and flow features such as reattachment lines and shear layer formation for headwind as well as cross-wind (Starboard 45°) respectively. Overall, the numerical results show reasonably good agreement with the experimental data. However, an asymmetry feature was seen at headwind condition similar to the Polsky and Bruner [103,104] and Sharma and Long [105] results. The author justified the occurrence of the asymmetry on the basis of ‘Flow Locking’ phenomena on one side of the bow.

Polsky [112] extended her earlier work and investigated the unsteady ship airwake at beam wind (wind from 90° starboard or port) conditions. Based on her previous investigations, she visualized that the beam wind would lead to very severe complex flow characteristics over the helodeck. This was the first instance when particularly an effect of beam wind was investigated in detail. Computational investigations at a 90° WOD condition were performed on the 1:100 scale SFS1 and full-scale US Navy LHA class ship. The SFS1 numerical results were compared with NRC wind tunnel data [57], and the LHA results were validated by JSHIP program's [103] sea measurements. Simulations were computed using the parallel unstructured Navier-Stokes solver COBALT with Monotone Integrated Large Eddy Simulation (MILES). Unstructured grids ranged 4.7–7 million cells while keeping y+ approximately of the order of 1. The first grid cell space was set to 0.015 mm for the full-scale case and 0.005 mm for the wind tunnel case. The author also highlighted the approach of choosing optimum modelling time required for the simulation. For example, a ship that is 244 m long in a 60 m/s freestream flow needs approximately 4 s for a particle to traverse the length of the vessel. Total ten air exchanges were considered before starting the collection of any data for comparisons with full-scale data. The outcome of the study shows that the agreement with the sea data at beam wind would greatly improve when an ABL profile is included for the full-scale numerical simulation of LHA. Moreover, a significant improvement was reported through time accurate simulation as compared to previous steady-state computations. Nevertheless, the separation region behind the superstructure did not show any improvement. It may be due to lack of turbulence modelling in the MILES code. Therefore, the author suggested a hybrid LES-RANS approach; Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES) for future unsteady airwake investigations to accurately resolve the separation region behind the superstructure. The reason behind such suggestion is the poor performance of the RANS-based models in the flow separation region, especially, near the stagnation wall region. Also, the RANS based modelling errors are typically larger than those introduced by other sources like numerical schemes, grid distributions, boundary conditions, etc.

Subsequently, Polsky's research group conducted a series of state of the art investigations on LHA class aircraft carrier airwakes. They extensively studied various aspects of aircraft carrier through full/model scale experiments and time accurate simulations. In continuation of the previous LHA airwakes studies [103,104,112], they reported an effect of bow flap on the flow separation characteristics on LHA at headwind conditions [113]. Outcome of the study shows that the inclusion of a leading-edge flap on the bow of the aircraft carrier can significantly reduce the length of the separation zone as well as the associated turbulence levels over the deck. Overall, the reduction in flow separated region and turbulence levels can lead to reduction in the pilot workload significantly, especially at the advancing side of landing spots. Later, this group also investigated the geometric characteristic of airwakes by implementing small geometric appendages [114,115]. They investigated the behaviour of small appendages i.e. antenna and mast airwakes and their widespread influence over the flight deck region. In general, the complex features of ships such as railings and antenna arrays were quite difficult to model using traditional meshing approaches. This leads to a requirement of a different strategy to overcome the difficulties associated with the traditional approach. The authors highlighted this research gap and proposed a ‘sub-grid scale model’ boundary condition to cover the faces of computational cells that intersected in the regions of small geometric array. Overall, the use of ‘sub-grid scale model’ demonstrates that the CFD grid resolution and time-step has a substantial impact on the level of agreement at the model-scale spectral data. In other words, the smaller time-steps, finer grids, and widespread sampling time-histories all together improved the agreement significantly. Also, the ‘sub-grid scale’ modelling approach seems to be suitable for approximating the first-order near-wall effects of small-scale geometric features. Similar work was done by Findley and Ghee [66] and Woodson and Ghee [116] on the DDG-81 Flight II-A class destroyer, where they computationally and experimentally determined the airwakes. Computational investigations were conducted and validated at two WOD conditions of 0° and Green 10°, respectively. The reason behind selection of the Green 10° WOD condition was the availability of full-scale telemetry data of the H-60 Seahawk helicopter approaching a Flight II-A class destroyer. Hotwire anemometry was used for experimental measurements. Overall, the comparison between experimental and computational data for velocity and turbulence intensity was not encouraging and showed asymmetry in the computed results. No reason was given for the discrepancy seen in the CFD results. The spectral analysis of the velocity time-histories at three locations over the helodeck conducted were captured correctly by the computational simulations. The spectral analysis of velocity time-histories confirmed that the majority of the highest peak of turbulent energy range was between Strouhal number of 0.1–0.5, which is similar to the conclusion of Sharma and Long [105]. Later, Mateer et al. [133] also conducted a similar kind of investigation and studied the unsteady aerodynamics of a ship's bulky enclosed mast through the DES approach in detail. Overall, the studies related to antenna and mast airwakes highlighted that they distort the air flow significantly and create a massive unsteady wake downstream of the mast which certainly raises the adverse effect on the ship-helicopter onboard operations.

A research group from Liverpool University contributed significantly in the area of high-fidelity DI simulations. This group started with the experimental and numerical study of the two baseline TTCP frigate ship models [117]. Firstly, the authors conducted a numerical study to get the simulated TTCP ship airwake data at various WOD conditions. For this purpose, they used the FVM based CFD solver Fluent (steady RANS) with two-equation turbulence models. Two turbulence models, namely, realizable k-ε and standard k-ω were used with SIMPLEC algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling and higher order QUICK scheme for momentum and turbulence equations. Further, the simulated results were validated against the experimental data reported by Zan et al. [57] and Lee [64]. The authors also followed the guidelines of Zan [110] for multiple WOD condition validation and validated for two wind conditions, namely, headwind (00) and Green (starboard side) 450. The validation showed reasonably good agreement with the experimental data; however, it was weakest in the separation region around the ‘bow’ and the ‘smoke funnel.’ The authors found that the k-ε model gave slightly improved results as compared to the k-ω turbulence model. Afterwards, the high-fidelity experimental studies were conducted on a computer based high-fidelity re-configurable flight simulator called ‘HELIFLIGHT.’ The main features of the flight simulator included a six degree of freedom four-axis programmable control loader, and a three-channel collimated visual display for forward view, plus two chin windows. For ship-helicopter test trials, a Lynx-type helicopter flight dynamics model was considered. The authors modelled the helicopter flight dynamics including a blade element representation of the main rotor, with a dynamic inflow to model the delay in the reaction of the air mass in the vicinity of the main rotor. The tail rotor was modelled using a Bailey disc model and aerodynamic models of the fuselage and empennage were also included. An elementary Stability and Control Augmentation System (SCAS) was also modelled and engaged throughout the test trials. Subsequently, the simulated SFS airwake data was exported to the flight simulator and several in-house flight trials were conducted to mimic the first-of-class flying trials (FOCFT) process and collect data at different WOD. Later, this time accurate flight simulator data was used for the preparation of the ship helicopter operation limit (SHOL) for the dynamic interface of SFS2 and Lynx helicopter. Based on the collected data, the authors prepared a SHOL map and predicted the pilot load variation plot called the ‘Deck Interface Pilot Effort Scale’ (DIPES). Overall, it was a maiden attempt of flight simulator piloted trials over a range of wind directions at different speeds. Based on this work, the authors produced a steady-state SHOL diagram for a ship-helicopter combination. The trends of wind strength and direction were reasonably well representative of a typical SHOL envelope. However, it was estimated that the overall workload was too low probably due to the steady-state CFD airwakes data. Hence, the authors strongly emphasised the necessity of unsteady CFD airwakes data to improve the fidelity of the simulation and CFD look-up table approach for modelling the actual ship-helo operation limits.

Later, this work was extended by Forrest et al. [74] with time-accurate actual ship airwakes data in which the authors used the hybrid RANS-LES approach (DES) for numerical simulations. In addition, the authors considered two actual ships namely, Type 23 Frigate and Wave Class AO for simulation. The authors conducted intensive time-accurate investigations and gathered unsteady airwake data at six WOD conditions, different wind speed range from 10 to 25 m/s along with the ABL velocity profile. The authors found that the time accurate airwakes overcame the limitations of their past studies. Also, the anticipated ETP experience due to the effect of turbulence in the oblique wind conditions, i.e., at Green 450 WOD condition was measured precisely by the flight simulator, and it was clearly shown that the turbulence was encountered at the flight deck from the port side superstructure. Similarly, the other phenomenon, such as the updraft over the port side deck edge for red winds and pressure wall were also observed. In classical metrology, the updraft phenomenon is commonly known as the condition when the air currents are moving upwards, and it usually occurs due to the turbulence created when air passes over topographic barriers, such as ship superstructures. The pressure wall phenomenon occurs due to the sea currents when an asymmetrical flow around a vessel leads to pressure variations between the starboard and port sides. Additionally, differences in the airwake load were observed between the T23 ship and AO ship. The ship-helicopter interface data suggests that the difference in airwakes load occurred due to the relative size of the ships leading to airwakes with different frequency content. Overall, the presented methodology showed that high-fidelity DI simulation is a key asset at the design stage to assess the structures underlying airwake aerodynamic and flight-test data. Thus, this study can be considered as a milestone in terms of accomplishing the high-fidelity simulation of the DI process.

In continuation, the effectiveness of the DES approach in ship-helicopter dynamics interface simulation recommended earlier by Polsky [112] was also reported by Forrest et al. [118,119]. Due to the advantages of the hybrid RANS-LES formulation technique, the authors used the DES based shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model (SST-DES) with the unstructured grid of 6 million cells at y+ ≤ 10. They selected two ship geometries, namely, SFS2 and Type 23 frigate model with the cylindrical computational domain for simulations. The flow was simulated at several wind over deck (WOD) conditions with uniform and ABL velocity profile. Comparisons between the DES prediction with experimental velocity contours, time-accurate velocity vector plots and turbulence data showed good agreement. The authors also highlighted the effect of including the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Overall, the DES approach showed promise regarding effectively capturing the large-scale turbulence structures, especially near the wall. The application of the unsteady hybrid RANS-LES method generates large data which pose another challenge for data transfer and management issues. To address these issues, they proposed a unique post-processing technique called ‘Wavelet Decomposition’ for efficient handling of three-dimensional unsteady datasets [120]. This method is based on the neural network technique. Overall, this method demonstrates a promising approach to predict the pilot workload at early design stages of the ship and could be suitable for producing an initial prediction of ship-helo operation limits. Alongside, the Liverpool Research group also investigated the ship superstructure aerodynamics to assess the efficacy of a flow modification device on a frigate ship [[121], [122], [123]].

In 2009, Zhang et al. [124] continued the trend of unsteady ship airwake investigations. The authors selected the baseline 1:100 scale SFS2 frigate ship geometry with a density-based Cobalt solver at three speeds; 30, 51, and 60 m/s and two WOD conditions; 00 and 450 for study. Cobalt is a parallel, steady/unsteady, compressible Euler/Navier-Stokes, unstructured grid solver. An unstructured tetrahedral grid with 2.53 million cells was used for the study. The simulated results matched reasonably well with the wind tunnel experiments reported by Zan et al. [57]. The Cobalt solver captures the unsteady ship air-wakes, mean and unsteady flow topology correctly. Results demonstrate crucial unsteady characteristics of flow through velocity histories with respect to time and their spectra. However, the reported computational results show asymmetrical trend, despite the symmetrical ship geometry. It is observed that all predictions made using the Cobalt solver have an asymmetrical flow field despite the geometry being symmetrical. Many researchers agree that this asymmetrical behaviour of the flow field may be attributed to the numerical inaccuracy of the solver [104,112,116].

Subsequently, Thornber et al. [125] explored the possibility of the Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) method for ship airwake simulation. The ILES simulation for full-scale ship airwakes was a challenging task due to the computational resolution requirements for high Reynolds number flow. On the other side, the application of the LES approach contains several difficulties for the case of complex ship geometry and the capability of sub-grid model is also of concern to describe direct energy cascade, see details [137]. The ILES is a higher order finite-volume scheme to capture the inviscid cascade of kinetic energy through the inertial range, while the inherent numerical dissipation acts as an implicit sub-grid model, forming a natural form of LES. The ILES method was developed through the application of monotonically integrated schemes. It was first proposed by Fureby and Grinstein [138], Visbal and Rizzetta [139] and Visbal et al. [140] in early 2000. The idea behind this approach is that the dissipation of the numerical scheme can serve as a sub-grid model of turbulence under specific circumstances [139]. Thus, under such circumstances, it is possible to get an accurate description of the turbulent cascade through solving N-S equations instead of LES equations. It is not necessary to introduce a sub-grid model of turbulence. In an earlier version of this approach, called ‘MILES’, monotone schemes of the second order of accuracy were used [103,104]. However, the authors used dissipative schemes of a higher order of accuracy under the UK Ship/Air Interface Framework instead of a sub-grid model. The authors selected two ships, namely, Type 23 frigate and Wave Class ship for their full-scale numerical investigation. Both ships were discretised by the curvilinear (body-fitted) multiblock method with grid sizes; 7.8 million for Type23 and 8.8 million for the Wave Class ship. For simplifying grid requirements, the authors did not attempt to model the boundary layer of the ship, and it was assumed that it does not influence the quality of the wake prediction. The authors used the fifth order accurate Godunov method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. A validation exercise was done against full-scale experimental data provided by Qinetiq (A British Multinational Defence Technology Company). Eight different WOD conditions were simulated for both the ships, and the results were compared with the full-scale and wind tunnel experimental data. Variation of the eddy structures at different WOD conditions were described through the ‘Q criteria’ and the Power Spectrum Density (PSD) variations. The ‘Q criteria’ uses the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor, and, the PSD is defined as the power in the fluctuating turbulent velocity in a given direction. PSD is computed as the square of the Fourier transform of the flow velocity, divided by the time duration of the time sample, giving an energy per unit time per frequency band. Overall, the comparisons between experimental and computational data show decent agreement with the frequencies range of 0.1–10 Hz, which is consistent with the past literature. Besides, WOD scaling was also demonstrated by comparing 300 scaled field data and actual field data. The authors found that the velocities and their fluctuations are self-similar with the scaling of WOD velocity. The WOD scaling also revealed that the flow over an actual ship is insensitive to the variation of Reynolds number. Moreover, the spectral analysis proves that the scaled frequency content of the flows at different WOD is very similar. Thus, it could lead to eliminating the requirement of time-accurate ship-airwake investigation at different WOD conditions i.e., limited WOD conditions is sufficient to recreate the complete 3600 WOD conditions through flow scaling.

Muijden et al. [126] in 2013, conducted a computational ship airwake determination to support ship-helicopter DI assessment. For this purpose, authors used two different numerical techniques, namely, a hybrid RANS-LES method and the conventional steady RANS method. The authors assessed the performance of both methods. For hybrid RANS-LES simulations, the unsteady eXtra-Large Eddy Simulation (X-LES) was adopted. Whereas, for steady RANS simulations, the TNT k-ω model was implemented. The X-LES offers ease of switching between RANS and LES-regions by automatically determining the LES filter width and the RANS mixing length scale. This approach significantly reduces the higher-order artificial dissipation terms as compared to the RANS-approach. Hence, it leads to lower dissipative characteristics of the flow. Also, it is less dependent on the turbulence model, since the larger resolved vortices (large eddies) in the grid are computed directly in a time-accurate way. Similarly, the TNT k-ω model offers improved turbulence modelling through the Explicit Algebraic Reynolds Stress Model (EARSM) enhancement and is computationally economical. A TTCP SFS model with two configurations, namely, a realistic bow and a realistic landing platform dock were selected for the numerical and experimental investigations. The experimental investigations were performed primarily by the PIV technique. Additionally, hot-wire and pressure probe measurements and flow visualisation using smoke, oil and tufts were also performed. The authors presented a reasonable comparison of computational results with the experimental data. Overall, it was found that the hybrid RANS-LES approach shows better agreement with the deviation in velocity ratio being of the order of 0.1. On the other hand, the steady RANS approach shows deviation of the order of 0.2 with the experimental data. Surprisingly, despite the higher physical level of flow modelling, the hybrid-RANS method could not resolve all the scales which had been captured by the PIV experiments. Also, the gain in 0.1 order of higher accuracy lead to increase the computational cost in comparison to steady RANS. Therefore, the authors asserted that the steady RANS approach is beneficial and economical at an initial design stage to get a first insight into the average ship airwake flow field characteristics over the helodeck. Likewise, the choice of the computationally more intensive unsteady method would be better for capturing the fluctuating flow-field characteristics. In addition, the authors suggested using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which is a unique post-processing technique to convert the time-accurate flow field into a suitable data block for the helicopter flight simulator. The POD would also allow handling large amounts of high-dimensional data by adapting low-dimensional descriptions. The low-dimensional descriptions data only retain the phenomena of interest and overcome the burden of storing the full dataset (see Ref. [127] for more details). Briefly, the application of the POD method would remove the limitations of storing the full CFD-dataset on the helicopter flight simulator. Thus, POD offers a smooth conversion procedure to store only essential modes together with the time-dependent coefficients for effective helicopter motion simulation.

Shukla et al. [128] continued the studies similar to that done by Thornber et al. [125] and Muijden et al. [126]. In contrast to the previous studies, Shukla et al. [128] adopted the URANS approach instead of RANS-LES hybrid approach for the unsteady ship airwake simulation. The authors' main objective was to assess the capability of the URANS approach to capture the unsteady features of the ship airwake and to examine the feasibility of URANS data for ship-helicopter DI flight simulation. This study was the extension of their previous work [100]. The authors conducted a full-scale time-accurate numerical investigation on the TTCP frigate ship by URANS and compared it with steady RANS data. The authors found that the URANS method captures reasonably well the unsteady nature of the ship airwake eddy structures, and is feasible for DI flight simulation. However, it could not resolve the dominant frequency effectively because of the limitation of the RANS-based model's time-averaging method. Further, the authors also studied the geometric features of the ship through modified ship superstructure configurations. Their results show that the modification of the TTCP/SFS ship by adding a semi-cylindrical shaped helo-hangar decreases the eddy structure of the flow over the helodeck and has a potential to minimise the impact of ship airwakes on the helicopter aerodynamics significantly.

Rui et al. [129] assessed the hybrid RANS-LES method for unsteady ship airwake simulation. The authors used the entropy based detached eddy simulation (S-DES) and the steady RANS Spalart–Allmaras (SA) model for numerical investigation of the flow over the generic TTCP simple frigate ship (SFS1). The S-DES version method moderately suppresses the modelled stress depletion (MSD) phenomenon by employing the entropy concept to separate the local boundary-layer region. The MSD phenomenon refers to the incorrect behaviour of DES in thick boundary layers and narrow separation regions. This behaviour usually begins when the grid spacing parallel to the wall becomes less than the boundary-layer thickness [141]. Till the present date, several formulations have been suggested for the DES method to mitigate the MSD phenomenon (see details [142]). The authors adopted a fifth-order WENO scheme, and a fourth-order central differencing scheme for the inviscid and viscous terms, respectively to minimise numerical dissipation. For temporal discretisation, second-order accuracy was achieved by applying dual-time step with the sub-iterative procedure. The validation was performed with experimental data reported by Mora [71]. Results show that the S-DES method can capture the SFS ship airwake better than the SA turbulence model. For further simulations, the authors modified the SFS geometry by removing the exhaust funnel on the helo-hangar and identified the mechanisms of turbulent vortex structures formation in the ship airwake. Comparisons between the modified and original TTCP geometry revealed that the flow gets separated initially from the head of the ship and generates a high level of unsteady shear layers with turbulent vortex structures shedding while travelling downwards. During the dissipation process, these vortex structures get elevated by encountering the exhaust funnel. Further, these structures interact with the vortex being shed from the edges of the hangar roof. This interaction results in increased energy containing vortex structures, which cover the landing area over the helodeck and affect the DI process. The authors also studied the effect of the hangar door state through fully open and half-open hangar door cases. Interestingly, they found that the downwash turbulence is minimum for the case of half-open hangar door, whereas, the flow reattachment point is almost similar in both the cases.

As more unsteady simulations were performed, the volume of numerical data increased dramatically. This required advancement in data storage and transfer methods. As a result, investigations on advanced data transfer techniques for computational methods also started simultaneously in late 2000. Quon and Smith [130] highlighted the use of such advanced data transfer techniques called ‘overset methodology’ for ship airwake numerical computations. The authors evaluated the overset methodology on the turbulent three-dimensional airwake of a TTCP frigate ship model. The advantages of the proposed method can provide ﬂexibility in modelling the ship under different operating conditions as well as different frame motions, which is highly desirable to model a high-fidelity ship-helicopter DI. To investigate the efficacy of the overset method, four grids from the range of 2.7–3.0 million nodes were generated. The first grid with a single grid conﬁguration was used as reference, thereafter overset grid conﬁgurations including a near-body ship grid and a background grid were created with y+ ≤ 1. Results showed a dominant frequency of 7.8 Hz in both the streamwise and normal velocity components. The authors adopted a similar method which was suggested by Polsky [112] to calculate the optimum modelling time required for the simulation. The flow-field averaging was performed over a period of 0.128 s, which is equal to the time needed for the freestream flow to traverse the length of the vessel. Overall, the adopted overset approach demonstrated its effectiveness by eliminating problems associated with orphan points and reduced the transient conservation errors.

In 2016, Paul [131] investigated the full-scale unsteady multi-hull ship airwakes using the URANS approach. It was the first implementation of a trimaran hull on a destroyer ship called “Littoral Combat Ship (LCS 2)”. The advantage of using a tri-hull was to provide a more significant helodeck area by increasing the ship beam length. Additionally, the tri-hull also offers superior design and relatively higher operational speed along with providing higher stability at a lesser draught. The author conducted full-scale unsteady simulations at two wind speeds; 5, 10 m/s and WOD conditions; 7.50, and 150. Due to the complex ship geometry, the associated computational time and cost were very high. This restricted performing time-accurate parametric investigation. Results show that the application of a tri-hull significantly reduces the vortex structure outside of the hull and immediately downstream of the hull opening. The flow through the main and outrigger hulls results in a deceleration of airwakes and minimises the impact of the complex airwake flow characteristics that contributes to high pilot workload. Besides, the study also highlights that the URANS approach could capture the vortex shedding and adjacent wall airwakes reasonably well. These findings are consistent with the conclusions of Shukla et al. [128]. Later, the author used computed time-accurate velocity data in a flight simulator for DI simulations. However, the author did not show the flight simulator results. Overall, the study shows that the flow characteristics over the helodeck improves relatively, especially at oblique wind directions. Further, the vortices persist downstream of the ship and quickly disperse across the longitudinal direction of the vessel.

Yuan et al. [132] also assessed the hybrid RANS-LES method for unsteady ship airwake simulation. However, the authors used a modified version of DES called ‘Delayed Detached Eddy Simulations (D-DES)’ due to the limitations of the basic DES formulation (see details [142]). The authors selected two 1:100 scale ship geometries, namely, SFS2 and CPF model with freeware CFD solver ‘OpenFOAM’ for simulations. The reason for the selection of two ship models was to check the efficacy of D-DES on simplified as well as real ship geometries. The SFS2 was a simplified ship geometry which was used for the validation purpose, whereas the CPF was an exact representative geometry of the frigate ship. For temporal and spatial discretisation, a fully-implicit, second-order temporal differencing scheme was used. The second order finite-volume approach was used with co-located grid arrangement. A hybrid structured and unstructured grid of 6 million cells with y+ ≤ 65 was used. Computations were performed with time step (Δt) 1 × 10−4 s for total eight seconds of physical time, resulting in 346 units of flow through time with 330 units for sampling. The spectral characteristics showed that the agreement between the computed results and the experimental data was reasonable for the SFS geometry. However, the agreement for the CPF geometry was not good probably due to the poor grid density. Further, the authors also highlighted the effect of freestream turbulence on the computed solutions. Typically, the turbulence intensity is a known parameter for any wind tunnel experiment, whereas, the turbulence length scale is an unknown parameter. Thus, a CFD procedure attempting to match experimental data has to rely on an unmeasured and uncertain value of turbulence length scale. For example, the DES method suffers from some uncertainty because it does need a turbulence length scale to accurately capture the eddy viscosity parameter. Therefore, the D-DES overcomes this uncertainty by modelling the turbulence length scale into the eddy viscosity (ʋt) at freestream conditions. The wind tunnel value of the turbulent eddy viscosity (ʋt) in the freestream is calculated with the empirical relation as follows;
(17)
where Cμ is a constant having a value of 0.09, I represents the turbulence intensity, L is the turbulence length scale and U∞ the freestream wind speed. The authors found that the freestream turbulence did not affect the mean velocity distribution; however, the spectral characteristics changed significantly.

Finally, all the reported references treating the computational modelling of ship airwakes are categorised under two categories; (i) computational studies based on mean-flow features in Table 10 and (ii) computational studies based on time-accurate flow features in Table 11. The presented summary includes objective, key findings, CFD solver/method and time step details of individual studies.

5. Coupled ship-helo airwake modelling
Investigations covering the coupled ship-helo airwake characteristics started way back in the 1990's. Till that time, the challenges associated with isolated helicopter airwake aerodynamics had been well documented, and early experimental investigations had already started. The researchers had foreseen the possibilities of high-fidelity and real-time ship-helo airwake investigations through the numerical modelling approach. In line with this idea, the researchers continued the investigation of real ship-helo coupled airwakes with certain assumptions for the helicopter flight modelling approach.

Most importantly, the term coupled airwake modelling refers to the modelling of the helicopter aerodynamic in ship airwakes leading to coupling between the different elements of the simulation. In other words, the coupling defines the type of the airwake interaction which will take place between the coupled ship-helicopter DI modelling. Thus, the level of coupling has a significant effect on the accuracy of the modelling. In this context, typically the level of coupling can be defined in two ways; (i) One-way Coupling, and (ii) Two-way coupling. The “One-way coupling” refers to a modelling in which the ship airwake is computed independently from the helicopter wake (see, Fig. 13) Likewise, the term “Two-way coupling” refers to a modelling in which the ship and helicopter wakes are both dependent on each other and computed simultaneously. Besides, the two-way coupling also includes the effect of the external environment (see, Fig. 14). The overall rank of ship-helo coupling may vary, and it depends on the assumptions of the particular modelling approach [143].

In 1994, an assessment of the coupled ship-helo airwake modelling was first performed by Erm [144]. The author developed a simulation program for a combination of the Royal Australian Navy FFG-7 class frigates and Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk helicopter (FFG-7/SH-60B). This program was based on Fortenbaugh's [134,135] model. To deal with different aspects of coupled ship-helo airwake DI, the FFG-7/SH-60B program included a number of different modules. Seven modules were included to model the ship-helo dynamic interface, namely, (i) Ship Motion Module (it modelled the motion of the ship as a function of ship velocity, wave front direction, and sea state) (ii) Landing Gear Module (it modelled undercarriage forces using non-linear equations which represent oleo strut (a pneumatic air–oil hydraulic shock absorber used on the landing gear of rotorcraft) deflection and tyre deformation. It also modelled the Recovery Assist, Secure, and Traverse (RAST) system) (iii) Airwake Module (it modelled the ambient atmospheric conditions as well as the ship airwake) (iv) Aerodynamics Module (it modelled the rotor and vehicle aero-dynamics of the SH-60B helicopter) (v) Engine Module (it modelled the engines, either separately or together, as well as the transmission system of the helicopter) (vi) Pilot Module (it modelled the pilot control inputs of collective and cyclic stick position, pedal movement, and throttle position) (vii) Control System Module (it modelled the mechanical flight controls and the Stability Augmentation System (SAS) feedback loops). The author made comparison between the velocities predicted by the program and measured during the full-scale tests on FFG-7. Overall, a noteworthy difference was seen between the predicted and measured velocity data. The possible reason behind the mismatch between full-scale and modelled coupled flow could be due to the assumptions of the simulation program. The simulation program only calculates the velocity at the center of gravity of the helicopter, and assumes that this velocity exists over all regions of the helicopter, which is not a correct representation of the full-scale conditions. Further, no account is made for the non-uniform velocity distributions over the rotor blades of the helicopter. A simplified actuator disk-type rotor model was used in the program. Such a model does not provide a complete representation of flight in turbulent airwakes. Besides, a rapid angle of attack change of the rotor blades induced by turbulence and mean-flow velocity gradients could not be captured. Thus, it is highly desirable to take account of velocity variations over the helicopter rotor in conjunction with a blade-element type of rotor model for effective coupled ship-helo airwake modelling.

Subsequently, the accessibility of parallel CFD computing resources encouraged the researchers to undertake unsteady coupled ship-helo flow-field investigations. In 1995, Landsberg et al. [145], investigated the nonlinear coupling effects of a helicopter downwash along with exhaust gas trajectories and concentrations over the unsteady ship airwake of the DDG-51 Destroyer using the parallel FAST3D solver at US Naval Research Laboratory. It was the first study which considered the rotor downwash phenomenon. In earlier studies, the coupled interaction of a helicopter downwash with the surrounding airwake has not been examined. Therefore, the integration of a rotor downwash model was implemented into the CFD code to explore the nonlinear coupled interaction for a helicopter with a specified flight path. The inclusion of a rotor downwash model was done by introducing a uniform vertical momentum flux. This momentum flux could be changed during the computations to simulate a helicopter flight at different approaching/landing positions. The helicopter hover location was kept at approximately 3 m above the landing deck on the centerline, whereas the main rotor blades with 16.5 m diameter were situated at 6.7 m above the landing deck. The flight path was specified to begin approximately at 50 m straight out from the landing deck with 2.5 m/s speed at a 30 vertical descent to the hover position. This speed was kept constant until the hover position was reached. Computations were performed at full-scale for a 10 m/s headwind speed, with and without downwash coupling, with open and closed hangar doors. Overall, the solution takes approximately 18.6 s to reach the hover position, and the simulation was carried out for a total of 25 s of physical time. Results showed that the downwash had significant effects on vertical and axial velocity over the helicopter landing deck. The power spectral density plots confirmed that most of the turbulent energy was in the range of 0.1–1 Hz. Besides, the authors also concluded that the open hangar doors had little effect on the flow field over the landing deck.

In continuation of a similar study, Tattersall et al. [146] conducted a CFD analysis on a regular naval ship with emphasis on understanding the coupled behaviour of the ship airwake. To model the coupled ship-helo environment the authors used a rotor performance code; Combined Rotor-Fuselage Model (CRFM) linked with the CFD code. The CFD code was based on the incompressible Euler equations with finite difference and finite volume formulation. The CRFM code was used to supply the distribution of pressure jumps as an input to the CFD code. The authors adopted a standardised actuator disc approach to model the helicopter rotor as described by Erm [144]. The flow field at the rotor boundary was used as an input to modify the rotor control angles in the rotor code, which in turn modifies the loading across the disk. These new loadings were fed back into the CFD code and the process was repeated until the two programs converged to a solution. The results are representative of the steady flow field around the ship and provide some indication of the control inputs required to respond to the time-invariant airwake. However, the authors failed to verify their proposed formulation and did not show any comparison between computed results with experimental data.

Advani and Wilkinson [147] outlined the challenges associated with the DI modelling and simulation, with a particular reference to the US Joint Shipboard Helicopter Integration Process (JSHIP) program [103,104]. It was the first most ambitious coupled ship-helicopter computational investigation undertaken during that era. A wide-ranging review of the requirements for piloted simulation of the ship-helicopter DI was performed to highlight the significance of the flight simulator, and suitable airwake models. Afterwards, the authors described the specific testing and validation for Dynamic Interface Modelling and Simulation System (DIMSS) in the JSHIP program. Similar to Erm's [144] model, Bunnell [148] applied the DIMSS to a combination of a US Navy LHA Class vessel and a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter by incorporating the different models namely, (i) helicopter aerodynamics model, (ii) ship airwakes model, (iii) ship motion model, (iv) cockpit sub-system model, (v) visual sub-system model, and (vi) body force cueing sub-system model, and provided the results of these trials. The purpose of JSHIP program was to allow the use of information of helicopters from the US Navy, Army, and Air Force on shipboard operations. In order, to emphasise the benefits of the JSHIP program, the DIMSS was demonstrated by the use of piloted flight simulation to develop appropriate launch and recovery limits. Validation of this approach was done by simulating UH-60/LHA deck landings. These were implemented by several pilots in the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) with the results compared to flight test data, which were recorded during full-scale sea landings. Overall, the study listed out some of the challenges associated with a coupled ship-helo environment. Besides, it also highlighted the overall procedure of how the JSHIP program attempted to create a simulation-based determination of the SHOL envelope for the specific ship-helo combination. Finally, the authors recommended considering the coupling effect between the rotor and the ship airwake for precise real-time modelling of piloted simulation.

In 2002, Wakefield et al. [149] proposed a new approach to examine the coupling effect between the rotor and the ship airwake. The authors conducted a computational study of a rotor hovering in a ship airwake (without fuselage). Initially, steady-state CFD simulations were done for the SFS at 0° and 90° WOD angles. Based on these two WOD angles, the ship airwake flow features were validated against the wind tunnel experiments. Later, a Westland Lynx Helicopter rotor model was placed over the helodeck to study a coupled simulation of ship airwake and rotor downwash. The effect of the rotor was modelled by modifying the governing Navier-Stokes equations by applying vertical and horizontal forces to the fluid near the rotor, using a radial variation of thrust. These extra terms added to the governing equations apply a downward force to the fluid. They assumed that these forces are independent of the flow around the rotor and are equal to the helicopter weight. Subsequently, the ship model and the helicopter rotor model were linked to produce one flow solution. In this manner, the authors were able to calculate the collective and cyclic pitch angles required to maintain a trimmed rotor by determining the induced velocity on the blades as a function of radial and azimuthal location. The authors showed that both 0° and 90° WOD conditions for hover over the helodeck (in the airwake) fluctuated significantly from a trimmed forward flight condition. Both cases required positive longitudinal cyclic, indicating a need for an increased pitch angle at the front of the rotor disk. The 90° WOD case required considerable positive lateral cyclic in order to compensate the updraft on the starboard side of the ship and downdraft on the port side. In addition, this study also showed that the mean velocity gradients caused by ship airwakes could cause significant variations in induced velocity over a rotor disk. The authors highlighted the interesting features of the coupling effect, namely that the 00 WOD case required the highest power as compared to the 900 WOD case. The reason behind such variation of power requirement was mainly due to the increment in the local wind speed over the helodeck. However, the increment in the local wind speed over the helodeck also increased the cyclic control parameters which may lead to affect the helicopter stability.

In continuation of coupled airwake studies, McKillip et al. [150] proposed another approach to DI modelling. The main objective of the study was the development of a fast and real-time free wake module, which could calculate ship airwake velocity fields coupled with a free-wake rotor model during piloted simulation. A novel physics-based computational method of representing the unsteady airwake of naval ships was modelled using vortex doublet elements shed from the sharp edges of the ship superstructure. The approaching rotorcraft was modelled by a panel-based fuselage model. The authors used a Cartesian Grid Euler (CGE) solver for the ship airwake and a Lagrangian Fast Panel/Vortex (FPV) solver for the rotorcraft. The CGE solver was based on a standard Navier-Stokes approach and optimised for octree decomposition. The FPV code was described as a potential flow solver representing shed wakes as curved vortex filaments. The CGE approach was able to predict separation from sharp edges but unable to predict vortex spreading due to dissipation in the numerical scheme. The FPV method allowed vortex filaments to propagate for long distances without dissipation. However, the separation points had to be defined analytically, which could be difficult for complex geometries. The authors demonstrated the validity of the adopted approach through limited qualitative comparison against the SFS experimental data.

Subsequently, Zan [151] carried out the first experimental investigation to establish the aerodynamic effects of a model-scale ship airwake on a scaled rotor. The main objective of this study was to gain some quantitative and qualitative understanding of the changes in rotor response in the ship airwake. A model-scale experimental investigation was undertaken at the Aerodynamics Laboratory of the Institute for Aerospace Research (IAR), National Research Council of Canada. The modelled rotor was placed behind the superstructure of a 1:50 scaled CPF ship in an approximated ABL velocity profile. The authors also conducted some experiments on the modified CPF geometry to gain insight into the effects of the superstructure geometry on the rotor loads. The modelled rotor was a generic configuration and was designed to mimic a typical medium-weight helicopter rotor. The modelled rotor consisted of four blade constant section (Clark-Y), constant chord airfoils with diameter 0.28 m. Each blade had a twist variation of 140 and was designed based on a simple blade-element model. The blade element model defined the thrust coefficient as
(18)
where T is the measured thrust, ρ is the air density, A is the area swept by the rotor blades, ω is the rotor rotational velocity and r is the rotor radius. Equation (18) gave the thrust coefficient in air as 0.00387, and the experimental thrust coefficient in the absence of the ship was estimated as 0.00367. Thus, the selected rotor model was reasonably validated by the thrust coefficient. It also implies that the modelled rotor produces an acceptable representation of the variation in spanwise loading of the rotor. The rotor disc plane was kept parallel to the ship flight deck plane for all tests. The operating condition for the modelled rotor; was Re = 105 × 103 and Mach number (M) 0.35. In addition to thrust coefficient matching, the velocities, geometries, and the rotor rotational frequency were also scaled. Since the ship model was kept at 1:50 scale, the selection of frequency scaling was conducted to determine the velocity scaling or vice versa. A frequency scaling of 35:1 was used for the experiment; this provided a velocity scaling of 7:10, and resulted in a model rotor rotational velocity of about 1150 rad/s. Most of the experiments were conducted at a full-scale wind speed of 19 m/s at 00 WOD condition. The author did not include the fuselage; thus, the drag and side forces acting on the rotor were not of interest in this experiment. Typically, the fuselage drag and side force would far exceed the force generated by the rotor. The time-averaged rotor thrust coefficients response due to variations in vertical and horizontal inflow were recorded at various points over the helodeck. Overall, the contours of the time-averaged thrust coefficient showed that significant gradients existed around the helodeck, with the rotor suffering a 10%–15% decrease in thrust behind the hangar. It was due to a combination of reduced horizontal inflow velocity (wake deficit), which arise from the airwake and the downward induced velocity component (downdraft) as the flow separates from the hangar roof. Besides, the author also showed that airwake effects become less critical as the free stream speed is decreased, due to the increasing dominance of the rotor downwash. From the modified ship geometry experiments, the author concluded that the changes in ship superstructure could reduce the severity of the airwake by minimising the spatial gradients of the rotor thrust coefficients and indeed increase the SHOL envelope.

Lee and Zan [152,153] continued the experimental investigation of ship airwake/rotor coupling through the wind tunnel investigation of a 1:50 scaled CH-124 Sea King fuselage and CPF model. The experiments were conducted in two stages. In the first stage, the rotorless CH-124 Sea King fuselage was positioned over the helodeck of CPF model and was studied [152]. In the second stage, a powered rotor CH-124 Sea King fuselage in the airwake of the CPF model was studied [153]. The main objective of these experiments was to study the coupled ship-helo dynamic interface environment. In contrast to their previous study, the focus of these studies was on the unsteady loading of the fuselage for rotorless and powered rotor cases. Measurements were performed with and without the rotor. The authors showed that the inclusion of the rotor causes higher levels of unsteady loading over the helodeck. For the rotorless case, they found that the majority of the spectral energy was at frequencies below 0.5 Hz. For the powered rotor case, the majority of the spectral energy was found at frequencies below 2 Hz. The RMS loading measured in the wind tunnel was correlated to the pilot workload ratings given during the Sea King flight tests. The results showed a reasonable correlation between derived RMS loading and pilot workload assessment during the flight test. The authors suggested that this approach could potentially be used to investigate the likely location of the SHOL boundaries before commissioning of the First of Class Flight Trials (FOCFT).

Over the years, researchers have developed a strong foundation in the area of ship-helo coupled airwakes. Also, the advancement of computational technologies gives an opportunity to do high-end research in the area of DI research. Towards this goal, Polsky [154] attempted to achieve an update on DI modelling by demonstrating coupled ship/rotorcraft (LHA/V-22) and ship/aircraft (CV/F-14) airwake computations. The author used COBALT and CRUNCH solvers for ship-rotorcraft and ship-aircraft simulation respectively. Both codes were run in the laminar mode only. The time steps were varied from 1 × 10−2 s for ship alone cases to 9 × 10−4 s for cases modelling the blade rotation. The author used an actuator disk model as well as a blade element model for modelling the blade flow dynamics. The key difference between the two models is that the actuator disk model applies a specified thrust, while the blade element model uses aerodynamic characteristics to calculate the thrust generated by the blades. The total grid size was of the order of 12 (5.8 × 106 for the LHA ship and 6.3 × 106 for the V-22 grid) and 17 (10.6 × 106 for the aircraft carrier ship and 6.3 × 106 for the F-14 grid) million cells, respectively. The initial simulation was performed on a V-22 hovering over the helodeck of an LHA ship. Investigations were conducted on WOD of 355° at 22 kt. The results showed that a highly complex coupled flow-field existed over the helodeck. Later, this capability was extended to include overset grids. The V-22 could be dynamically moved along an approach path to the LHA deck. The author asserted that the proposed dynamic moving approach provided a ‘proof of concept’ that this type of high fidelity simulation could be taken further. Overall, a single computation of a 30-s approach path was expected to require more than 150,000 CPU hours, corresponding to over a month of wall-clock time on 160 processors that results in substantial computational cost. This work demonstrates the important steps taken to employ CFD techniques to model coupled aircraft/rotorcraft and ship flow fields reasonably well.

Lee et al. [155,156], investigated the pilot control activity during helicopter shipboard operation in a shipborne environment. The authors examined the steady and unsteady airwake effect on the control activity of the human pilot model. For this purpose, an integrated unsteady CFD airwakes for an LHA class ship and UH-60A helicopter simulation environment was developed. The CFD airwake model PUMA2 coupled with the GENHEL helicopter simulation environment was used to simulate the shipboard landings. A control model of a human pilot was used to drive the aircraft model along with a pre-defined approach trajectory. The resulting control activity predicted the pilot workload during the landing task. Two WOD condition; 0° and 30° were simulated. Comparisons of both the WOD airwakes showed that the 30° WOD case contained spectral content with higher amplitude. Due to the presence of this higher spectral content amplitude the aircraft suffered correspondingly larger oscillations and increased control activity during the approach condition. The DIMSS pilot workload metrics used for simulating the deck landings were compared with results from the JSHIP study. It was found that the magnitude of the DIMSS pilot workload metrics was lower for the pilot model. However, the trend of increasing workload with WOD angle was captured reasonably well. Further, it was found that the key difference between the control strategy for the no airwake and steady-state airwake cases was the adjustment of aircraft altitude and trim to overcome the spatial velocity gradients in the airwake. On the other hand, significant aircraft oscillations and pilot activity were observed over the helodeck for the time-accurate airwake.

Lee and Horn [157] presented an overview of the considerations required for accurate DI modelling and simulation. Details of an optimal control model of a human pilot were also given. This work is merely an extension of their previous work [156]. Time-histories of modelled control inputs from a flight through a full time-varying CFD airwake was compared with the sea flight test data obtained during the JSHIP program. In the vicinity of the ship, the agreement was qualitatively decent, however the pilot model underpredicts cyclic activity. Further, the authors introduced a method for representing airwake disturbances using stochastic modelling techniques to overcome the enormous storage requirement for three-dimensional unsteady airwake look-up tables. Later, the pilot control activity using a stochastic model was compared with the full time-varying airwake. The PSD plots of aircraft rate response and control inputs showed that the stochastic model appeared to give a reasonable approximation of the higher fidelity model in the range 0.03–1 Hz. The authors also recommended the use of filters in the stochastic airwake model to optimise the helicopter flight control systems, for the improvements of the disturbance-rejection properties of the aircraft during shipboard landings.

In 2007, Almpan et al. [158] and Bridges et al. [159] attempted to demonstrate the effects of coupling on the flight dynamics, by GENHEL software with the PUMA2 CFD code. The authors asserted that the advantage of this approach allowed to model the full coupling of an unsteady airwake with rotor downwash in off-line computations. In this approach, the blade loads and positions were first calculated by GENHEL software and then passed to the CFD code, which in turn applied similar force terms to the computational cells for generating downwash. Afterwards, the calculated local air velocities by PUMA2 were fed back to the rotor model, which updated the blade loads and positions before starting the loop again. The authors could not run the time-accurate simulations due to the requirement of enormous computational effort. So later they used an optimal pilot model to control the helicopter flight path. All computations were conducted for the hover and approach condition over the deck of an LHA amphibious assault ship. Both cases were tested with no coupling (i.e. steady wind only), one-way coupling (look-up table approach) and two-way coupling. Later, both cases were compared to flight test data, including aircraft position, attitude, pilot control input time-histories and spectra. The authors assumed an inviscid flow-field along with atmospheric turbulence. The boundary layer effects were neglected. For the hangar test, it was found that the effect of the coupling was to force the shed vortices downwards, away from the rotor to diminish their impact on the helicopter. Thus, disturbances were smaller for the two-way coupled case as compared to the one-way coupling. However, this reduction in perturbations and control activity, led to decreased agreement with the flight test data. In contrast, the one-way coupling matched more closely with the magnitude and frequency of attitude disturbances. It was found that the differences between the one-way and two-way coupling were less noticeable during the LHA test because the LHA airwake was dominated mainly by vertically aligned vortices. Further, they observed that vortices with a vertical axis were not as easily displaced by the rotor downwash, so tended to persist into the disk. Overall, the two-way coupling did not appear to offer a sufficient increase in agreement with flight test data over one-way coupling. These studies demonstrated the importance of the coupling on the pilot workload reasonably well.

On the other hand, the flow around the isolated helicopter itself is associated with several complex flow phenomena namely; tip vortices of the main and tail rotors, main and tail rotors flow interaction with the fuselage, dynamic stall of the rotors, blade sailing and large flow separations behind the fuselage. Thus, the prediction of the dynamic flow conditions around helicopters using CFD methods was considered as one of the most challenging problems in aerodynamics [160]. Also, the non-availability of sophisticated experimental data in the open domain posed another constraint on such investigations. To address these constraints, the GOAHEAD experiments were conducted to provide extensive data for the validation of full helicopter configurations at various flight conditions in 2012–13. Five test cases; (i) A low-speed (pitch-up) condition, (ii) A cruise condition, (iii) A high-speed tail-shake condition, (iv) A highly-loaded rotor (dynamic-stall) condition, and (v) A very high-speed condition were modelled experimentally to cover different helicopter flight speeds and rotor loadings. The wind-tunnel model used in the GOAHEAD project consisted of the following parts: (a) A Mach-scaled fuselage model (1: 3.881 scale) of a modern transport helicopter (the model had a length of 4.15 m and was modified by removing the undercarriage nose wheels and closing the exhausts). Besides, the model was also upgraded by introducing a new tail fin and tail rotor unit (b) The rotor (including hub) consisted of four blades equipped with a swept (parabolic with anhedral) tip geometry and had a diameter of 4.2 m (c) The two-bladed tail rotor (diameter: 0.733 m) had a S102 (cambered) airfoil. The experimental rig was built around a fuselage model of the NH90 helicopter, mounted on a streamlined strut. The helicopter model was trimmed in the wind tunnel to minimise forces and moments on the mast. The free-stream Mach number of 0.059 corresponded to the blade advance ratio of 0.096. The fuselage was positioned with the nose-up pitch attitude of 1.9°. The experimental data collected included recordings of unsteady pressure levels at 130 different locations on the fuselage, fin, tail plane and main rotor blade. The authors also carried out PIV measurements in a frame above the tail plane that showed the location of the vortices shed by the main rotor. Further details about the GOHEAD project included the experimental and computational set-up, and these can be found in Schwarz et al. [160].

The Liverpool research group also started investigations into the coupled ship-helo airwake area in 2012–13. Kaaria et al. [161,162] motivated by Lee at al [152,153]. work performed similar sets of experimental and numerical investigations on the coupled ship-helo airwake interaction. In contrast to the work of Lee at al. [152,153], the authors used an Airwake Dynamometer (AirDyn) to characterise the aerodynamic loading of a helicopter immersed in the airwake of a generic Shortened Research Frigate (SRF) ship. The AirDyn was a 1:54 scale physical model of a Merlin AW-101 helicopter, with an externally driven main rotor, see details [163]. The experiments were conducted in a water tunnel at two different WOD angles; 00 and 450. Typically, for a wind tunnel, keeping the rotor intact and controlling the rotor speed to match the rotor tip speed with free stream speed is a significant challenge. The poor matching of velocity results into decoupling of the rotor to the fuselage. Thus, the advantage of conducting experiments in a water tunnel provides the Reynolds number matching with more modest flow velocities. The ship and AirDyn Reynolds number was 1.3 × 105 (based on ship beam) and 1.14 × 105 (based on rotor diameter). Since water was used as a working fluid in the experiments, the compressibility effect (Mach number scaling) was not modelled. For the numerical simulations, the authors used FVM based CFD solver (FLUENT) with DES model at 6 million cells. This airwake generation method was extensively validated against model-scale and full-scale data, provided by Forrest et al. [118,119]. The comparisons between the computed and measured airwakes showed reasonable agreement. Results showed the region of ‘thrust-deficit’ in the headwind and a ‘pressure-wall’ in the 450 WOD condition. Besides, it also showed that the peak RMS loads were high for the oblique wind condition (Green 45). Further, the authors extended their work and evaluated the aerodynamic impact of ship superstructures on helicopter operations through a ship superstructure modification [164]. Overall, the studies showed that the virtual AirDyn approach is capable of measuring the aerodynamic loading imposed on a helicopter by a ship's airwake. It also confirmed that ship superstructure modifications can minimise the severity of unsteady aerodynamic loading caused by the ship airwake.

The most recent contribution on the problem of ship-helo coupled airwake interactions was reported by Crozon et al. [165,166]. These studies were the first attempt to simulate the manoeuvring helicopter during ship landing using a single framework to couple CFD and flight dynamics. The study demonstrated the feasibility of coupling a comprehensive rotorcraft code with a CFD tool to achieve high-fidelity simulation of the challenging DI interaction. In the initial stage, the authors conducted a shipborne helicopter simulation under the CPF ship airwake environment [165]. The actuator-disc method was used for the coupling between ship and rotor. The actuator disc adds momentum to cells and attempts to maintain the required pressure jump across the disc to produce the required thrust. The authors used the Helicopter Multi-Block 2 (HMB) solver for simulations. The HMB2 solver is a Navier–Stokes solver employing multiblock structured grids along with the trimming method. The trimming method permits to determine the rotor collective and cyclic inputs to reach a target thrust coefficient while keeping the rolling and pitching moments close to zero. For simulations, the URANS (k-ω model) and DES methods were used by the authors. Results showed that the URANS and DES models exhibit similar mean flow characteristics. Besides, the study also demonstrated the importance of coupling effects on the wake and rotor inflow when the rotor is operating close to the ship. Predictions of rotor thrust matched reasonably well with the available experimental data. Further, the authors claimed that the superposition methods for coupled ship-helo investigation are not valid. The superposition method had frequently been used to simulate the coupled ship-helo airwake effects without the conventional coupling. A similar approach was adopted earlier by Nacakli and Landman [69] in their ship-rotor experiments.

Crozon et al. [166] also simulated the high-fidelity fully coupled ship-helo configuration and demonstrated coupling of CFD and flight mechanics for DI. The adapted CFD method (DES and SAS) solves the Navier-Stokes equations directly in the inertial “earth-fixed” frame of reference. Besides, the helicopter aerodynamics was solved by the ‘Helicopter Flight Mechanics (HFM)’ solver based on ‘Blade Element Momentum (BEM)’ along with a trimming algorithm and a pilot model. They neglected the aeroelastic effects on the rotor blades. Three cases were simulated to validate the coupled solver. The first case was SFS2 at 15 million cells, and the second case was the GOHEAD helicopter including the fuselage, main and tail rotor at 90 million cells. Finally, the third case was the CPF-Sea King helicopter including the fuselage, main and tail rotor at 31 million cells. All three cases were validated against the available experimental data given by Rosenfeld et al. [76], Schwarz et al. [160], and Lee et al. [153], respectively. A moving mesh method was implemented to accurately simulate the relative motion of any grid with respect to another. They also claimed that the scale adaptive simulation (SAS) performed well and maintained reasonable unsteadiness even in coarser grid regions. Besides, the SAS model is numerically stable and least expensive compared to DES. Thus, the authors preferred the SAS model over the DES model in their ship airwake studies. For coupled shipborne simulations the authors selected the ship and helicopter speed at 10 m/s, respectively. To overcome the vast timescale differences between ship and helicopter wakes, the authors initialised the simulations with a larger time-step. Further, they used the ‘Linear Integral Convolution (LIC)’ method to visualise the coupled ship-helo airwake data. The LIC method was initially proposed by Cabral and Leedom [167] for an intuitive description of the flow field. It is a generalisation of the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) line drawing approach described by Bresenham [168]. Results showed that there is separation between the ship and helicopter wakes, with the helicopter wake being distorted by the ship wake behind the helo-hangar. The ship-helo coupled flow topology captured by SAS and DES models demonstrated similar mean flow characteristics. Further, the authors suggested a ‘Reduced Order Modelling (ROM)’ method (for details of ROM method, see Ref. [169]) to analyse and efficiently handle the coupled ship-helo data. The ROM method is similar to POD and wavelet decomposition methods which were also used for the efficient handling of large amounts of high-dimensional data. Application of such method could allow performing real-time fully coupled simulation data management efficiently. Overall, the study demonstrated the feasibility of coupling a comprehensive rotorcraft code with a CFD tool to achieve high-fidelity simulation of the challenging ship/helicopter airwake interaction.

Finally, a summary of all the reported references which have been gathered under the coupled ship-helo airwake modelling review is presented in Table 12. Further, an overview of various types of coupling used for coupled ship-helo airwake modelling is summarised in Table 13. Finally, a list of key experiments conducted for shipborne rotors/helicopter under ship airwakes environment are presented separately in Table 14.

6. Findings
In the present article, progress in the experimental and computational modelling of the ship-helo coupled airwake aerodynamics, and Dynamic Interface (DI) has been discussed. The open literature on the subject of ship airwake estimation methods is reviewed in detail. Further, a relevant summary is tabulated to provide the readers with appropriate reference material. The reliable and accessible Dynamic Interface prediction methods that allow assessment of the relative helicopter motion is of signiﬁcant importance in the naval field. Availability of such prediction methods provides a promising approach for the design process at early stages, and minimises the ship-helo test trial burden.

Based on the studies reported in this review paper, the key findings are listed below. These findings are categorised pertaining to the following headings: (i) General, (ii) Experimental, (iii) Computational, and (iv) Flight Simulator.
(i)
General
a.
The effectiveness of ship-based naval helicopters is dependent on the speed of deployment and the ability of the rotorcraft to take off and land safely in all but the most severe weather conditions. Thus, it is highly desirable to remove the design limitations associated with the ship as well as helicopters.

b.
Overall, four key aspects affect the shipboard operations: helicopter flight characteristics and limitations (performance and control), ship environment (flight deck and equipment), pilot & pilot-helicopter interface (capability, procedures and human factors) and atmospheric conditions (weather and geographical locations).

c.
As per the ship's design perspective, the primary design consideration for the dynamic interface is the ‘near wake’ flow field behaviour over the helodeck. In contrast, the helicopter aerodynamics and the helo-downwash behaviour in the far wake are not too critical for the ship designers.

d.
The turbulent wake that develops over the ship's helodeck region as a result of the atmospheric wind and the forward ship motion has a complex flow structure with flow separation due to sharp edges, strong unsteady vortices and high levels of turbulence. Also, the inclusion of helicopter downwash changes the global wake and creates a coupled aerodynamic problem.

e.
For a typical frigate ship, the longitudinal velocity perturbation that arises from the recirculation zone, and the ‘ground effects’ of the rotor are the primary two causes, which affect the shipboard helicopter operations. Initially, the ground effect is negligible as compared to longitudinal velocity perturbation, but it increases gradually as the rotorcraft gets closer to the helodeck.

f.
For the case of a hovering rotor operating near the helodeck, the development of the rotor wake is constrained, forcing it to expand radially. The ‘ground effect’ decreases the induced flow through the rotor and increases the angle of attack of the blades. As a result, the wake first contracts and then rapidly expands as it is convected away from the rotor by the mean flow. Simultaneously, the vortex interactions of individual blades take place and start pairing up with more massive coupled structures.

g.
The crosswind conditions are relatively termed as more precarious for the shipboard operations. In high crosswind condition, the mutual interaction between the bare shipboard airwake and rotor wake increases the lateral velocity perturbations, which adversely affect the helicopter's stability.

h.
To deal with the complexity of the ship-helo dynamic interface at crosswind conditions, different take-off and landing procedures are followed in which the most common take-off and landing procedures are; (i) A fore/aft or forward-facing procedure, (ii) Relative-wind or into wind procedure, (iii) Cross-deck procedure, (iv) Aft/fore or forward-facing procedure, and (v) Astern Procedure (see details [170,171]).


(ii)
Experimental
a.
In order to model the free-stream airflow on a ship in a wind tunnel, the mean speed profile, the turbulence intensity, the ratio of the turbulence length scale to the ship beam, and the spectrum function should be similar to the full-scale flow. However, the necessity of modelling the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) depends on the Jensen number (Je) criterion.

b.
The non-intrusive flow measurement approach (optical anemometry) is superior in terms of accuracy and performance for experimental modelling of the ship airwake. However, the intrusive flow measurement approach (thermal anemometry) is more effective for the near wall region measurements.

c.
Ship airwake experiments highlight that the ship airwakes are typically unsteady in nature. Besides, the disturbed airwakes at the helodeck region have significant turbulent energy in the frequency range of 0.2–2 Hz.

d.
It is observed that the turbulent energy at a frequency below 1.5 Hz over the helodeck has a significant impact on the helicopter aerodynamics, and results in increased pilot workload.

e.
The frequency spectra of transverse and vertical flows over the helodeck show that the dominant non-dimensional vortex shedding frequency for a ship lies in the range (Strouhal number) of 0.16–0.25.

f.
The global behaviour of the ship airwake flow is Reynolds number independent beyond 104. However, the influence of Reynolds number on the blade aerodynamics in reverse flow over the helodeck remains to be examined. Typically, the airloads on isolated airfoils are highly sensitive to Reynolds number at low angles of attack [172].

g.
An appropriate flow scaling is required to calculate the full-scale data through model-scale data and vice versa. Overall, three flow scaling criteria; namely, Strouhal number scaling, Mach number scaling and Reynolds number scaling have been frequently used in the past studies of ship airwakes.

h.
It has been found that there are very few experimental studies on the behaviour of the shipborne helicopter in the ship's airwake. Besides, the effect of rotor-downwash/airwake coupling is still not fully understood and is often omitted from most airwake investigations using wind-tunnel experiments.


(iii)
Computational
a.
The main concerns of coupled ship-helo modelling include; (i) complex geometry, (ii) large turbulence length scales, (iii) high velocity rotor wake, and (iv) unsteady incompressible/compressible flow.

b.
A number of simplifying assumptions are usually made during the modelling of the dynamic interface; (i) assuming that the ship airwake is not affected by the ship motion, (ii) neglecting the effects of atmospheric wind turbulence and sea motion, (iii) simplified representation of ship deck and rotor wake (simplified ground effect), and (iv) one-way coupling in modelling interactions between ship/helicopter aerodynamics and dynamic interface.

c.
For any ship-helicopter combination, the pilot workload, thrust and pedal margins are the three main contributors which define the operational limitations. Also, the relative importance of these three contributors is directly linked to the wind conditions. Similarly, the other contributors are, the updraft phenomenon (effect of vertical velocity component), the pressure wall phenomenon, and airwake turbulence.

d.
The superposition method is not valid for coupled ship-helo investigation. It is observed that a conventional coupling is required to capture the coupled ship-helo airwake accurately.

e.
It is observed that there is an absence of design criteria in the open domain to grade a particular combination of ship and helicopter for ensuring minimum standards of safe operations. In contrast, such design criteria are available for offshore helicopter operations [[173], [174], [175], [176]] and VTOL aircrafts operations [177] in which the common design criteria are based on the updraft phenomenon, and airwake turbulence. Interestingly, both these phenomena also limit the ship-helo operations. CFD can be employed to develop such design criteria at initial stages.

f.
The helicopter design is critical for ship-helo operation. It is highly necessary to improve the capability of high power-to-weight ratio engines, ability to counteract the rotor-torque reaction, stability for a range of flight conditions, ability to autorotate in case of engine failure, and ability of multi-terrain landing, especially on the oscillating shipboard. Computational investigations are conducted at initial stages to achieve such design requirements.

g.
The near wall modelling does not seem to affect the accuracy of the numerical solutions because the ship airwake flow is mainly inertia-driven and the separation points are fixed by the sharp edges rather than caused by the boundary layer separation.

h.
The bare ship airwakes, as well as the ship-helo coupled airwakes are captured reasonably well with URANS and RANS-LES hybrid approaches. Overall, the scale adaptive simulation (SAS) performed very well for the coupled ship-helo airwake CFD simulation.

i.
To date, CFD is able to support real-time flight simulations and is used mainly to enhance the realism of flight simulations. Such enhancement is beneficial and is used for flight tests as training tools at the early design stage. However, it is very clear that computational modelling alone will not be able to replace the sea trials.


(iv)
Flight Simulator
a.
Real-time piloted flight simulations of ship-helo DI are of great interest, especially to support the training of future pilots and the characterisation of Ship Helicopter Operational Limits (SHOL).

b.
Flight simulation environments implement a flight mechanics model to reproduce the behaviour of a given rotorcraft. It predicts the rotorcraft attitude from the flow-field velocity data taken at defined locations on the rotorcraft body and blades.

c.
There is a requirement for a suitable post-processing technique which converts the three-dimensional time-accurate DI flow field into an adequate low-dimensional data set for the flight simulator. Such techniques listed in the literature are the POD, Neural Network, and ROM methods. These methods will ease the burden of handling a significant amount of high-dimensional data sets and allow efficient data management.

d.
The flight simulators can be considered as a means to extend or partially replace the sea trials at an early design stage. Sea trials are still required for initial validations.



Overall, CFD and flight simulator have emerged as good alternatives to wind/water tunnel studies of the coupled ship-helo DI problem. CFD investigations for the combined ship-helo DI problem are reported in the recent publications over the last five years. These trends indicate that such simulations, including sea and ship motion modelling, are soon going to be a reality in the near future.
